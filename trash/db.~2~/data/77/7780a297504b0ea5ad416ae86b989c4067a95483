         <p>In this video I showcase the main features and workflows of <code>vc</code>.  This
is a generic framework that can be used with several version control
systems, one of which is <code>git</code>.</p>

<p>I am using VC in parallel with the more powerful <code>magit</code>.  The former is
for smaller, simpler operations.  The latter is for the advanced
features that <code>git</code> provides.</p>

configurations.</p>
