         <p>In this video I demonstrate a few techniques to replace search matches
across a number of files or buffers, using a variety of tools.  The
tools I use involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>counsel-git-grep</code>, which is powered by the <code>ivy</code> completion
framework and which can edit its output with <code>wgrep</code>.</li>
  <li><code>ivy-switch-buffer</code>, followed by <code>ibuffer</code> and <code>occur</code>.</li>
  <li><code>dired</code>, followed by an interface that looks like that of <code>occur</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other commands where <code>query-replace</code> and keyboard macros.</p>
