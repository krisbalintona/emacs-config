         <p>In this video I demonstrate the custom extensions that I have written
from Emacs’ file manager program: <code>dired</code>.  Dired is very powerful
out-of-the-box and those extras build on what is already available.  In
short: (i) a general purpose command to insert the contents of
subdirectories in the current buffer, (ii) a more convenient tool to
limit the buffer to items that match (or not) a given regular
expression, (iii) commands to navigate subdirectory headings including
an <code>imenu</code> index, (iv) other utilities to determine the external program
for a certain file type.</p>

<p>I document everything at length in my dotemacs and also share the exact
configurations I use daily: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<p>Everything is part of my dotfiles’ repository (and the source code
contains informative documentation strings):
