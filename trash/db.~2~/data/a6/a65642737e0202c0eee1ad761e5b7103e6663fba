         <p>In this screen cast, I offer an introduction to GNU Stow.  Its manpage
describes it as a “software package installation manager”.</p>

<p>I personally use <code>stow</code> to exercise centralised control over sets of
custom configuration files.  It makes things considerably easier,
especially when working with complex directory structures, such as
those found in <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>In the video I also make reference to my latest book, “<a href="https://protesilaos.com/pdfd">Prot’s Dots
For Debian</a>” (PDFD) which contains a
section on how to use GNU Stow for the purposes of reproducing my
custom desktop session.</p>
