ability to read a <code>deuteranopia</code> value.</p>

<p><em>Deuteranopia</em> describes insensitivity to the green channel of light.
This includes the possibility of not distinguishing between red and
green; the two colours that are typically codified in diff buffers as
denoting “removed” and “added” states respectively.</p>

<p>Evaluating <code>(setq modus-themes-diffs 'deuteranopia)</code> and then re-loading
the theme of choice will replace all instances of green in diff buffers
with variants of blue.  This affects the standard <code>diff-mode</code>, Ediff,
Smerge, Magit, Vdiff, and any other library that inherits from those.</p>

<p>Below are illustrations of the phenomenon while using Magit diffs as an
example with word-wise differences enabled (“refined” diffs).  We try to
simulate how deuteranopia is experienced.  Those with it see red and
green as variants of brown/yellow and interpret shades of magenta
without its red channel’s intensity (magenta consists primarily of red
and blue, so it looks closer to a desaturated blue).</p>

<h2>Red VS Green (default)</h2>

<h2>Accessibility broadly understood</h2>

<p>While <a href="https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes/">the Modus themes</a> are not
designed with the express goal of optimising for deuteranopia across all
of Emacs’ interfaces, we can always make steps towards improving that
experience.  The fact that we already conform with the highest standard
for colour contrast (WCAG AAA) puts us in a good position to expand our
commitment to accessibility so that it accounts for variations in colour
perception.</p>

<p>Designing for such cases is no mean feat.  I had to take screenshots of
all relevant configurations, display them in the GNU Image Manipulation
Program, and set a filter that simulates deuteranopia vision: from GNU
IMP’s “View” menu, search for “Display Filters” and then apply “Color
Deficient Vision”.  That had to be done tens of times during the testing
process.</p>

<p>What inspired me to add support for <code>(setq modus-themes-diffs
'deuteranopia)</code> is the blog post of Sam Kleinman (aka “tycho garen”) on
<a href="https://tychoish.com/post/editor-themes/">Editor Themes</a> (2021-02-24),
which echoes the relevant wishlist item on my project’s issue tracker
(<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/issues/118">issue 118</a>)
where I got feedback from Hörmetjan Yiltiz.</p>

<p>Apart from its immediate utility, consider this new feature a statement
of intent: I want to make the themes as accessible as possible and am
willing to act on user feedback to that end.</p>

<p>If you believe something does not work properly while using either
<code>modus-operandi</code> or <code>modus-vivendi</code>, please do not hesitate to bring the
issue to my attention.  Colour is a complex phenomenon: even when we
formally conform with the lofty target of a minimum 7:1 contrast in
relative luminance, we may still encounter cases where things do not
“feel right”.  We can always fix those outright or, where necessary,
benefit from the power of Elisp to provide the relevant customisation
options.</p>
