         <p><code>ibuffer</code> is a library that is built into Emacs.  It allows us to
operate on the buffer list in a number of ways.  We can sort, mark,
filter using several predicates such as buffer name, major mode,
filesystem path.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <code>ibuffer</code> provides convenient access to other built-in
commands, such as <code>query-replace</code> and <code>occur</code>.  You can use these to
operate on a subset of marked buffers.</p>

on this and other tools.</p>
