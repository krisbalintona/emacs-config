         <p>In this video tutorial I offer a tour around the main interfaces of
Gnus, the built-in Emacs newsreader and email client.</p>

<p>I switched to Gnus full-time about a week ago.  I use it to keep track
of mailing lists and to handle my email correspondence.  The experience
is quite pleasant and I am excited about the possibilities it opens up.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for the
documentation and package declarations I provide.</p>
