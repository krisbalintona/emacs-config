         <p>In this screen cast I present the various customisations I have made
to Emacs’ built-in directory editor (file manager).  <code>dired</code> is a very
powerful program.  These improve upon various aspects of its behaviour
and functionality.</p>

<p>The changes I have made are part of my <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">“dotemacs” init
file</a>.</p>
