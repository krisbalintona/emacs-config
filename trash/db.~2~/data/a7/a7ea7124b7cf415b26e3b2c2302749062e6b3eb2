         <p>In this video I demonstrate two built-in tools for navigating large
files in a manner that is both efficient and convenient.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>outline-minor-mode</code> can be combined with a major mode for
programming, such as <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>, to produce headings that may
then be expanded or contracted (same idea as with Org mode).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>imenu</code> presents a dynamically-generated index with points of interest
in the given buffer (e.g. headings), allowing you to jump to one using
completion methods.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both tools are complemented by other packages as well as my own
functions and minor extras.</p>

and relevant documentation.</p>
