         <p>Eshell is a line-oriented command shell that is deeply integrated with
the rest of Emacs.  And it is extensible in true Emacs fashion.</p>

<p>In this video I showcase the extensions I have programmed for it.  The
idea is that you can see in action the value of using Elisp for your
regular command-line needs.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for all the
configurations for this and other tools.</p>

forget the official manual):</p>
