         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate a couple of ways of storing and
restoring window layouts in Emacs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The one involves <code>winner-mode</code>, which keeps a record of window and
buffer changes, allowing you to go back and forth in this history.</li>
  <li>The other uses a couple of functions provided by <code>ivy</code> to store any
window layout and to call it at any point in time using a search
interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>This video builds on my previous entry on the topic of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-08-18-emacs-buffers-windows/">buffer and
window management in
Emacs</a>.</p>

<p>And here is my own config file, in case you are interested:
