         <p>In this video I announce the immediate availability of my themes for
Emacs through the official package archive.  I explain what this means
in practice, how the new legal arrangements stand, and talk about my
plans concerning the ongoing development of this project.</p>

<p>The “Modus themes” are my highly-accessible themes for GNU Emacs. They
conform with the WCAG AAA standard for colour contrast accessibility,
which stands for a minimum contrast ratio of 7:1 between the foreground
and background values.</p>

<p>The two themes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>modus-operandi-theme</code> (light)</li>
  <li><code>modus-vivendi-theme</code> (dark)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the link to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes">GitLab repo of the Modus themes</a>.</p>

<p>You might want to send your feedback concerning the proposed changes to
<code>diff-mode</code> that I mentioned in the video.  If you do not have a GitLab
account, feel free to <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact/">contact me</a> via email.</p>
