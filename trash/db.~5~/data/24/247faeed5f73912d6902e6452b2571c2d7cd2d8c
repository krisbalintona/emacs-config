<h2>About this book</h2>

<p>In terms of content, this is a work on philosophy that touches on some
political themes.</p>

<p>As for its overall style, it marks a departure from the strict format I
adopted for my previous <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/">books and
publications</a>.</p>

<p>This is an experimental project.  One chapter employs irony from start
to finish.  Another follows from there to make a case against it.  There
are passages that try to be more humorous or “tongue in cheek”.
Overall, this is a free form text that may or may not succeed in the
task of addressing the overarching theme of human self worth.</p>

<p>This booklet is concerned with the set of narratives we formulate about
ourselves.  The idea we have about the world and our place in it.  The
values we adopt have implications on how we organise society and
determine the way we conduct our politics.</p>

<p>The various items that contribute to the broader tradition underpinning
human’s self evaluation may not be political in and of themselves.  It
is their cumulative effect that is felt in the domain of politics.</p>

<p>To this end, the reader is expected to connect the dots wherever
necessary.  My interest is to elaborate on the general features of the
subject of inquiry, allowing space for a range of possible conclusions.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>On Human Self Worth</em> is an attempt at something new in my
philosophical musings.  I might build on top of it, if I feel satisfied
with this direction, or learn from its shortcomings and adapt
accordingly.</p>

<h2>Contempt</h2>

<p>I have yet to see an animal other than human that can treat its
immediate experience, its entire life, as inherently false, decadent,
and only worthy of contempt.  Perhaps that is why we think we are
special.  We can contemplate our role in the world.  Who we are, what we
do, why, how, and what should be changed, if anything.  Human justifies
this capacity as hinting at a higher end, or some greater scheme about
us compared to the rest of the world.  There is a role we have to
fulfil, a destiny that is ultimately linked to our very being as humans.
And so, one thinks that there is a sense of higher purpose to their
presence which is not limited to their life.  And somewhere along those
lines, the theologian—or however we call people who talk about god[s]
and neighbouring concepts without ever furnishing any kind of
objectively verifiable proof—will insert their system of unfounded
claims about what the intentions of god[s] are.</p>

<p>We are special.  Such is the basis of our reasoning.  Only humans can do
philosophy, for instance.  Only we possess the mental capacity to grasp
the higher order realities that are not susceptible to the faculties of
sense.  We are unique among the animals, for we can escape the narrow
confines imposed by biological necessity.  Or so the thinking goes.  We
can fathom a state of affairs where we are detached from the world.
Aloof from the fray of material needs and bodily experiences, we can tap
into an ultimate reality.  Strip away all the phenomenalities.  We
consider these deceitful, <em>lies</em> that beguile our senses.  The true
reality, or the ultimate destination we should strive for, has no place
for them.  That is the end goal: to connect to the essence of the world.
The choice we believe we have is, therefore, quite simple in its basic
formulation: live as a beast by succumbing to your natural inclinations,
or actively suppress them in order to ascend to an intellectual being.
The spiritual self is the true self, the immutable and eternal.  Harness
it to fulfil your role in this world.</p>

<p>Such is the value we can attach to ourselves.  We say we are rational
animals, conveniently downplaying the whole host of behaviours that do
not conform with that rigid ideal.  We think we are calculative and
operate on the “margin of rationality”, as the economist would put it,
always optimising our choices.  There is imperfection and irrationality,
biases, uncontrollable emotions, decisions that are adopted without
complete knowledge of things—for is there a single domain where we claim
<em>complete knowledge of</em>?  These do not change the narrative of our
exceptional status.  We can overcome them, so long as we keep sight of
this narrow subset of human experience that we consider so important.</p>

<p>But there is disagreement amount the proponents of human exceptionalism
as to what the differentiating factor is.  Those who do not place
disproportionate value on human reason find something else to venerate.
It goes by various names, such as the “soul”, the “spirit”.  These can
be cultivated in a variety of ways other than what we associate with
rationality, in order to attain the same objective of ascendance.</p>

<p>That is a distinction between rationalists and spiritualists, whose
midpoint is the thesis of human beings as the chosen ones.  <em>Human as an
entity sui generis.</em></p>

<p>The <strong>first issue</strong> I see with such exceptionalism is ontological
dualism.  The mind, the soul, the spirit, or whatever it is that is
responsible for reasonableness and/or spirituality is treated as a
distinct entity from the rest of the body.  The latter is the domain of
the bestial.  Our ephemeral self.  The instincts, the emotions, the
irrationality.  Whereas our true self is detachable from the body.  It
can be freed from it.</p>

<p>The specifics of the narrative vary, depending on the tradition
concerned.  Is it not bizarre though, that whatever the details we have
no indication whatsoever of some other ‘essence’ that is somehow
intertwined with our base being?  Our capacity to think clearly is a
function of our body’s inner processes and of its health.  If you do not
nourish yourself properly over an extended period of time, you will not
be able to think correctly.  If you feel pain, that is all you care
about.  Are you delirious in fear?  Forget about plotting the most
precise course of action.  If you get knocked on the head you might stop
thinking the same way you could before.  An injury is the definition of
being affected by this world.  You can claim that rocks are somehow fake
and not worthy of ‘real’ experience.  Fair enough, note though that a
phenomenality that smacks you on the forehead can still send you to the
hospital.</p>

<p>In the same vein, we have no indication of the soul as a distinct domain
of agency, let alone a separate ‘essence’.  Whatever the particularities
of the narrative, it builds on the presumption of a transcendent soul,
simply working backwards from a conclusion.  Which is to say that it is
dogmatic.  So, you claim that the soul transcends the rules of this
world and that it is eternal?  And yet, here it is, ‘trapped’ as it were
inside a human body, which is to say that it is, after all, bound by a
subset of the rules of this world.  For the body is a natural system, a
subsystem within the broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>You want to emancipate your soul by performing all those rituals or live
life in a certain way.  There may be benefits to that mode of living,
such as mental health. Do it!  But the very claim that the transcendent
is at once above this world and yet decisively confined to the secular
or the cosmic is absurd.  If it is transcendent, how do you measure it?
How can you possibly claim it is ‘there’.  For if it is <em>somewhere</em>,
then by definition it occurs within space.  If, on the other hand, it is
just a thought of ours, then how can we even insist on the notion that
it is bound to the body?</p>

<p>The more you delve into the inner contradictions the more likely it is
to encounter mysticism.</p>

<p>As a first line of defence comes the tactic of belittling us compared to
some exalted being, which itself is unverifiable.  We are too foolish to
understand the grand design.  Throw in some allusion to our ape minds
for good measure.  It is hubris to use our logic and our faculties of
sense as means of debunking those views of the world.  Just believe and
you will see the way.  At which point you single out the double standard
whereby their claims are not to be questioned but the sceptic’s argument
must always be refuted by the very inability of human beings to grasp
the ‘truth’.  Then, when the mystics are pressed on their
epistemological inconsistencies they resort to propositions of the sort
<em>“god works in mysterious ways”</em>.  Looks aporetic on the surface, but
actually clings on to a well defined set of beliefs.  Perhaps the very
antithesis of inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>As <strong>a second issue</strong> with the schools of thought that propound notions
of human exceptionalism, I would suggest that perhaps our claims about
the soul, the true self, immortality, all trace their roots to biology.
They are perhaps rendering lucid a base instinct.  Now this is rampant
speculation from my side and no more that a hypothesis that would need
to be tested, but here it is: what if our survival instinct is in fact
taking over our thinking processes, trying to make sure that we survive
no matter what?  And what if, by extension, the idea that we can live
forever in some shape or form is but the impression of
rationality/spirituality derived from instinct?  Again, this is
speculation that would need to be backed up or dismissed by a fully
fledged research programme.  So I continue: if we are hard wired to
survive, and if this drive is perceived in a different form as pure
reasonableness or spiritual enlightenment, then perhaps the very notion
of rationality/spirituality and of the true self is but a heap of
misunderstandings or illusions.</p>

<p>Everything in this world is subject to probabilistic cause and effect.
Our bodies—mind included—are dynamically influenced and determined by
their internal processes as well as stimuli external to them.  This
complex interplay produces thoughts and triggers for action, which among
others lead to new learned experiences and patterns of adaptation, and
so on.  Maybe—just maybe—we are led by our instincts to think of
ourselves as operating free from biological impulses, in the same way
the dog impulsively gives chase to the ball thinking it is desirable to
run after the ‘prey’ even after it knows that the ball is, in fact, a
toy.  Perhaps then, the notion of finding our true self is an exercise
in futility.</p>

<p>We can only be our nature—there is no choice involved.  Choice concerns
what we could consider as second order items.  The ‘essence’, what we
are made of, remains outside our reach. We cannot choose to be non-human
or to pick and choose the part of humanity we want, such as beings
humans but forgoing the need to eat and sleep.</p>

<p>My point is that we need to gather findings, results that are
reproducible in a manner that is objective.  Else we add to the echo
chamber, perpetuate a tradition just because we find solace in its
teachings.</p>

<p>Speaking of solace, is not fear a byproduct, or somehow linked to the
survival instinct?  Why are we afraid of things, if not because they
might threaten our existence either fatally or partially by exposing us
to a potential injury?  Fear is a manifestation of the struggle for
survival.  Again, this should be put to the test, such as to see if
plants feel fear and adapt their behaviour accordingly.</p>

<p>If all my speculation would translate into a fully fledged research
project, I would suggest that we delve into this notion of consoling our
soul, of ataraxia, or whatnot.  Is it emancipation from whatever
temptation or power holds us hostage to our base instincts?  Or are we
just desperately seeking answers as a means of alleviating our
existential fear?  Anything will do, regardless of its correspondence to
the actuality of things.  Just give a plausible answer, which all too
often delivers us the nostrums of mysticism.</p>

<p>The <strong>third issue</strong> with human exceptionalism is its propensity for
nihilism.  Everything in this world is framed as an illusion of sorts.
And people are, by default, <em>mere animals</em> that have yet to ascend.
They might have the potential to see the light, though they are nowhere
near it in their natural state.  It follows that all that happens in
this world, our politics, the economy, culture and sport, are lesser
activities.  They do not, in and of themselves, take us to this supposed
next level.  They are distractions or, at best, activities with
secondary values.  No wonder many of those harbouring contempt for the
world argue for withdrawing from society in pursuit of enlightenment.</p>

<p>Nihilism is the dark side, if you will, of idealism.  Or rather of the
conflation between the ideal and the actual.  Idealists of this sort
have a very stylised view of how the world ought to be.  It is not
corresponding to things as they are.  It is a product of their prior
exceptionalism.  The domain of the god[s], the eternal soul, human’s
capacity to ascend, the falsehoods of phenomenality.  If you only want
ideal beauty, then everyone out there is ugly.  The ideal is an
abstraction, derived by tracing the common in the multitude of
phenomena.  Abstractions are products of thought.  And products of
thought can be shared between humans because we have the same biology.
Just as the design of our hearts, or lungs, or limbs is the same, so are
the basic functions of the mind.  There are differences.  Differences of
degree, not category.</p>

<p>The misguided idealist of the sort here considered will insist on
attaining the abstract.  They believe their obstinacy will reify their
imaginary state of affairs.  Eventually, a tension arises between
expectation and results.  Rather than recognising the original confusion
between the ideal and the real as the source of the problem, it is the
world that has to bear the brunt of the blame.  This world which is
fake, hypocritical, decadent…  This world that only keeps the
soul/spirit/mind/whatever chained to an inferior reality.  Thus comes
nihilism.  There is nothing real or worthy in anything human does:
pleasures of the body are bad, because the body is the soul’s prison,
the source of base instincts, etc.  Interest in politics is inherently
misguided because <em>“all politicians are the same”</em> and the world is
corrupt and evil.  Besides, why bother changing your immediate life when
it is a “false life” after all?  And so the nihilist will expound on
their ideals and insist that what they care about is a true reality.  In
the meantime, they become the most reflexive type of ultra-conservative,
reverse apologists of the established order and of anti-research.
“Reverse apologists” in the sense that their intention is not that of
justifying the status quo, but that their behaviour contributes to that
end regardless.</p>

<p>If life in this world is a lie, why bother with a fairer distribution of
resources, peace within the family, mutual understanding between
cultures, or whatnot.  Why care about the ecosystem if, ultimately, it
too is an idol; at best a fake representation of reality?  There can be
no qualitative difference between annihilating all the species and
fighting to preserve the ecosystem’s balance <strong>if</strong> there is nothing
worthy in this world.  And the same can be said about all normative
issues that humans have to deal with in their collective life.  In
politics, that is.</p>

<p>The nihilists commit the error of using the ideal as the enemy, rather
than the guide, of the good, of the realisable.  Maybe they are not as
crude.  They might become selective nihilists, misanthropes for instance
where they blame humanity for everything that is bad while exalting
“mother nature” for all that is good.  And where does humanity come
from, if not nature?  The answer to this is predictably theological.  In
the Western tradition evil is attributed to “free will”, which is
another one of those baseless assertions like dualism and the
transcendent soul, afterlife, etc.</p>

<p>Free will, in its purest form, is the claim that there is at least a
kernel of human self—this notorious “true self”—that is not bound by
anything and only operates in accordance with its own devices.  What we
do is out our own volition.  There are no biological underpinnings, no
environmental stimuli, no social, cultural, historical artefacts that
inform our judgement.  This is the myth of the decontextualised human, a
being in itself, self contained, detached from the world, yet somehow
strictly confined to it.  Again, one can trace hints of dualism.</p>

<p>I am very much sceptical of this mumbo jumbo.  No doubt, it is a
powerful belief.  See, here I type <em>this</em>.  I just did it because I
decided to.  My will, my rules.  Ha!  But what if what we conceive as
freedom is but the expression—and inward impression—of a dynamic
probabilistic function of the interplay between internal processes and
external stimuli?  What if typing <em>this</em> is something that the complex
underlying processes of my being seeks and gets feedback from to
reinvigorate the cycle?  That would not be the kind of transcendent free
will of Western mythos, but another common phenomenon—or concatenation
thereof—of this world.</p>

<p>Probabilistic cause and effect.  There is nothing transcendental, truer,
or special about it.</p>

<h2>Godlessness</h2>

<p>I am an agnostic.  But let us start from another point.</p>

<p>In my everyday life I am atheistic.  I practice no rituals; do not
attach special, ‘mystical’ value to items; never think that certain
moves, words, thoughts, circumstances, signs, and the like, have any
connection to some ostensible “higher being”.  My quotidian experience
is not influenced or governed by beliefs of something ‘other’.</p>

<p>And I am similarly ‘atheistic’—if I may broaden the term—towards all the
expected formalities of our time.  I do not keep track of birthdays,
anniversaries, the “International Day of [insert theme]”, and whatnot.
Today is another day.  The Earth is still orbiting the Sun.  Sure, that
does not give me any social points, but who cares anyway?</p>

<p>I live like an animal, say, a dog.  Canines react to stimuli.  They are
hungry, happy, excited, scared, in relation to some phenomenon that may
be internal, external, or [most likely] a feedback loop between the two.
I just do what is within my power, what my nature renders possible.
Those who talk about spirits, ethereal beings and the like, those who
when pressed to prove their points inevitably muse about the ineffable
and neighbouring concepts, will accuse me of ‘materialism’; maybe even
of disrespect for my audacity to think that I, a mere human, can defy
the divine.</p>

<p>Atheists <em>are certain</em> that there is no higher being whatsoever.  Which
is unacceptable, as they put forward a positive proposition that is not
objectively verifiable.  In that sense, they are epistemologically
equivalent to the theists.  They too have no proof, other than
tradition, widespread superstitions, and stories that blend a kernel of
truth, say a meteorological event, with sheer fantasy.</p>

<p>Agnosticism is the view that we remain aporetic towards theological
propositions.  We can neither approve nor disprove them.  <em>We do not
know</em>.  However, agnosticism is not to be conflated with the
superficially compromising attitude of many eminent scientists:
<em>“science does its job, while religion has a moral role to play”</em>.</p>

<p>No, I am sorry!  We are not friends any more.  That is just a shrewd way
of not turning fanatics against you.  Tactically sound, but a spurious
statement nonetheless.  For if we can neither prove nor disprove the
claims of theology, then it follows that religions and quasi-religious
groups are overreaching.  They are abusing their power.  They <em>do make</em>
positive statements.  They do, indeed, claim to have answers and be
certain of things—usually of <em>all things</em> that trouble us.</p>

<p>If agnosticism is to be upheld, then religions cannot possibly be
anything other than cultural-historical constructs with a decisively
political function.  Let us discuss them in the same vein as all social
structures and institutions.  If they are deemed useful or surplus to
requirements is a matter of value judgements within the domain of
interpersonal experience.  In terms of their content, however, they
speak nonsense.  No religion has ever objectively substantiated its
claims. None of the world’s major religions has furnished proof covering
the totality of their propositions.</p>

<p>Which is also why agnosticism should not be misunderstood as passive
indifference, as “everything goes”.</p>

<p>I will return to the point of the “moral role”, after elaborating on
positive statements in general.  You see, agnosticism does not really
claim anything new.  It simply observes the fact that there are many
religions and conflicting accounts of theology, while there is no
mechanism of ever resolving the disputes (fire and steel
notwithstanding).  Some say there is one god, even though they are not
united on what that really means.  Others suggest that there is a
plurality of gods.  Then there is a whole host of spirits that rank
below god[s] but still partake of divinity.  Some are good, others are
evil, or whatever the binary/spectrum is.  They have passions and
feelings, mood swings even, and they draw up plans for various courses
of action in pursuit of their ends.  Furthermore, there are all sorts of
views on the origins of the world, the role of humanity in it, the life
of human beings now and in eternity.  And so on.</p>

<p>Agnostics take account of this corpus of work to state the obvious:
controversy implies unresolved tensions about the thing being studied.
It is not clear what the object is.  There is fundamental disagreement
about what should be discussed and the method to be used.  Agnostics do
what every sceptic does: they conclude that we need more work before we
can arrive at a satisfactory <em>starting point</em>, let alone a comprehensive
framework.  In this case, we would need to reach a broad consensus on
the thing being studied, as well as agree on a method that would lead us
to objective ways of approaching it.  Until then, the agnostic can only
state the readily apparent fact that when theology is taken as a whole,
it shows that we do not know anything about it.</p>

<p>Thus, unlike the atheist, the agnostic remains open to the possibility
that we might come to the point where we can acquire knowledge in this
domain.  It cannot be evaluated in prior, without clear reasons as to
why.  Atheism is a dogma similar to the Academic Sceptics of yore: they
were certain that they did not know, knowledge being an unreachable
Ideal and all that.  Yet, certainty of not knowing is knowledge in
itself, which would disprove the very notion of knowledge being
unattainable.  But I digress.</p>

<p>To me, atheism only makes sense as a term that describes certain types
of lifestyle, such as my own: the life of a dog.  It is not philosophy:
just a set of modes of living that do not rely on any kind of mysticism.
Live like an animal, for that is what humans are.  Our intelligence is a
difference of degree, not category when compared to the rest of the
species.</p>

<p>Whereas agnosticism is a philosophical statement.  And philosophical
statements are essentially analytical propositions, i.e. do not really
tell us anything new, other than dissecting the stock of knowledge—or
“justified true beliefs”, if you will—we have already accumulated to
discern its abstract structure and any possible constants therein.
Whatever findings the philosopher may come up with are already intrinsic
to the items of inquiry.</p>

<p>Think of it like observing a painting at a museum.  Your first
impression gives you a general idea.  Upon second look you start seeing
some finer points, the direction of the strokes, the thickness of the
brush, the hues, the texture.  And the more you study, the more you
discover, to the point where your final view of the painting has little
in common with your original impression.  All while the work of art
remains constant.  That is analysis!</p>

<p>Philosophy is an analytical venture.  Here is a four-fold rule of thumb
for identifying charlatans:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They claim something about the world that cannot be tested or studied
in an objective way.  <em>“This is how things stand and I know because
<strong>reasons</strong>“.</em> To support their claims, they may even synthesise
between vastly different traditions or fields of endeavour, often
picking and choosing the parts of science that superficially support
their case.</li>
  <li>They allude to philosophy, as a proxy for authoritative wisdom,
either claiming they are philosophers themselves, or selectively
interpreting the words of some well-known thinker who may remotely
give credence to their views.</li>
  <li>They change the criteria when pressed on a core tenet of theirs.
Such as that their truth being ineffable, the absolute ‘other’, or
just the oft-cited <em>“god acts in mysterious ways”</em>.  Otherwise they
attack your person: <em>who are you to question the divine?</em>  <em>“Our
feeble mind cannot comprehend the workings of god[s]”</em>, and similarly
convenient tricks of anti-science or anti-dialectic.</li>
  <li>They treat subjective experiences as equivalent to universal truths
and take offence at any hint that subjectivity is neither sufficient
nor reliable.  The usual defence is that <em>“well, I am not crazy!”</em> or
<em>“how can you prove that I did not have these experiences?”</em>.  Which
either attempt to end the discussion or force you to disprove them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Making positive statements means bearing the burden of proof.  You talk
about the will of the divine?  How god[s] bestowed upon you the power
you wield, which further justifies your special status in the social
order.  And so on.  How about you prove all this?  Oh, blasphemy!  I
know, I know…</p>

<p>Though this is exactly what we do with everything in life.  We ask for
evidence.  Your partner in life demands confirmation of your love on
what seems like an hourly basis.  You can’t just get away with empty
statements.</p>

<p>Here is more: a traveller went to the village on the other side of the
mountain.  They stayed there for a while, presumably because they had a
good time.  Upon returning, they raved about the otherworldly crops and
animals those people have.  Bananas that can be pealed off <em>and on</em>.
Donkeys that take flight and recite poetry.  Mice that turn down
invitations to infest your household.  Tomatoes that all kids find
tasty.  Sugar that is good for your health, especially when consumed in
great doses.  In short, the traveller regaled us with all those wondrous
stories.  And we threw a party to indulge in the amusement.  Then at the
height of it all, this one person who apparently detests fun addresses
the traveller: <em>why didn’t you bring any specimen?  How about we go
fetch some for ourselves?  Money is not an issue.  Did you at least
capture any video footage so that we can see for ourselves in the
meantime?</em> You know what kind of person asks these questions: a nag!
For it is annoying to have to prove such nice stories.</p>

<p>Same with all positive propositions: they are nonsensical for as long as
it is impossible to test and/or examine them objectively.</p>

<p>With that noted, let me return to the scientist qua infamous apologist
of the status quo.  This cliché that religion has to stay in place in
order to provide moral guidance to the masses.  Such a blatant double
standard by people who make a living off of the scientific method!
Think, if you will, what would happen if courts of justice would no
longer care about facts.  What kind of justice would they deliver?  The
judge ought to be a sceptic, only arriving at a judgement after
examining the available evidence.  Without facts there is no
adjudication of the case.</p>

<p>And the same is true for everything.  We trust engineers to build boats
that do not sink, or airplanes that stay aloft.  And we expect
consistency of results that approaches near perfection.  Performance,
which is to say, a verifiable state of affairs, is the measure by which
we decide whether to trust their work or not.  Even in politics, the
domain where countless opportunists have made a successful career,
people ultimately care about the truth.  Over the long term lies are
exposed by reality—and societies suffer the consequences.</p>

<p>Our entire collective experience rests on verifiability.  And yet, those
who are supposed to be champions of a method that yields verifiable
results mindlessly repeat this much-touted platitude that organised
religion—a social class whose power rests on unverifiable claims and
baseless assumptions—has a tutelary role in our society.  It is better
they remain silent if they have not thought things through.  Because we
live in an era where science is exalted as a new god of sorts.  The
nuance is lost, the methodological caveats are dismissed as pedantic
details.  <em>“Scientists prove that [insert supposed certain truth]”</em> is
the kind of news item you get in every media outlet.</p>

<p>The scientist must assume the responsibility their role entails.  They
need to be extra careful, else the pervasive scientism of our times will
twist their words in support of profoundly anti-scientific ends.  If,
however, the scientist wishes to speak their mind, they can do so
provided they make it explicit they do not opine in their capacity as a
scientist, nor do they represent science as a whole.  It is just their
opinion and should be taken as such, however whimsical it may be.</p>

<p>Some never learn though and will go to great lengths to defend their
frivolous attitude.  It is common to hear eminent scientists dismiss
philosophy altogether, while simultaneously holding some ridiculous view
about an item outside their narrow field of expertise.  The scientist
who shows unshakeable conviction about unverifiable theories is lauded
as a genius, the philosopher who recommends a rethink and to exercise
caution is publicly ridiculed as absent-minded and an armchair
commentator, deprived of funding, forced out of universities because of
their uselessness, put in the same league as astrologists and
theologians, etc.</p>

<p>The very fact that the scientist thinks they have all the answers is a
clear sign why they still need a philosopher by their side.  Make their
research interdisciplinary.  Inject some self criticism and restraint.
For those scientists are like balloons filled with helium.  If you let
them loose, there is no telling where they will go.</p>

<p>I guess, sometimes, when all is said and done, the best kind of
philosophy is this: oh, fuck off!</p>

<h2>Delusions</h2>

<p>Just to err on the side of caution, let me preface this with a “Not Safe
For Work” notice. Do not start reading out loud. Doubly so if your
colleagues are people of esteem, with high moral values.</p>

<p>You were hesitant at first, thinking about the longer term implications.
But now that you had sex are expecting a wedding ring.  Okay, it may be
a bit too early for marriage, but you are already looking for some
definitive proof of commitment to the relationship.  You muse about true
love, “now and ever after”, summer wine, the aroma of roses, the
sunset’s reflections in the water, and all the other tropes of tradition
and romantic poetry.</p>

<p>I have some bad news for you.  Love is not transcendent.  It lasts for
as long as it does.  It might be for a night, a month, a few years, or a
lifetime.  That is dependent on circumstances, ultimately tracing their
cause to biology.  You see, physical attraction is the epiphenomenon.
What is actually set in motion is a series of events that change the
degrees of certain substances in the body in relation to learned
patterns of social interaction.  I defer to chemists and psychologists
for the details.  What basically appears to be the case is that we
experience a change in our body’s equilibrium, which throws us off
balance, as it were, and we start perceiving things in a distorted way;
seeing the other with rose-tainted glasses.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when you first think of someone as beautiful,
kind-hearted, sweet, and the like.  There are no flaws.  Love at first
sight is the equivalent of poor eyesight.  It is akin to feeling angry:
you do not think clearly, your perception is twisted.  The beautified
view changes after a while, once the inner equilibrium is restored.
Prima facie you were attractive.  Now that normality has returned other
fields of endeavour demand attention.</p>

<p>Love is typically thought of as a permanent feeling.  Whereas <em>love at
first sight</em> is considered a passion.  To its credit, this distinction
recognises the physical impulse that is a passion.  Perhaps, then,
permanent love is a learned passion.  An adaptation to what once was the
abnormal and has now become the new normal.</p>

<p>At any rate, these things happen outside our control.  Do not fool
yourself.  Your mood is contingent on your chemistry.  You cannot just
fall in love if there is no underlying reaction that triggers the
concatenation of events we understand as, or associate with, affection.</p>

<p>It is pointless to speak of the natural condition in terms of good or
bad.  It is.  The normative value we attach to it does not affect it.  A
society may unanimously decide to banish breathing, out of concern for
the carbon it emits or the oxygen it consumes.  Good for them to care
about such things.  The only problem is that nature is mind-independent.
We can only influence those items that are contingent on human thought
and action; on human institution.  The rest is outside the reach of our
conventions.</p>

<p>Back to love and its meta-narratives.  We have forced ourselves into
this social mould where we pretend to love <em>once</em>.  Similar to the
futile task of prohibiting the respiratory system, our pretenses about
love’s pureness will eventually be confronted with reality.  At which
point we call the lawyer to prepare the paperwork for the divorce.</p>

<p>If a great number of marriages break up, and if those who remain in tact
are for reasons other than pure love, then we might as well not exert
this immense pressure on ourselves.  Yes, I am talking about taking love
at face value.  Living the moment.</p>

<p>Of course, there are good reasons not to be frivolous and to have checks
in place; reasons that relate to social organisation, public health and
welfare, or else politics.  For instance, it would be irresponsible to
impregnate women and let them face motherhood on their own.  They would
suffer.  The children would have a hard time.  Society would struggle to
cope with the likely surplus of orphans, and so on.</p>

<p>But that is not the point here.  I am referring to the pretenses we
maintain about an element of human relationships that is presumed as
eternal.  If it really is, then it does not need to be instituted as
such.  So it is not.  And we tacitly acknowledge that.  For while we
preach the ostensible transcendence of true love we also meticulously
take all necessary measures to treat it just like any other possession:
subject to constraints that create scarcity, or else exclusivity.</p>

<p>Striped of its theological underpinnings, marriage is an institution
that entails rights and obligations.  It is a cultural-legal instrument
that works just like property rights.  At best, a mutual claim of
ownership.  At worst, guarantees for sex on demand by the dominant party
to the relationship.</p>

<p>Then there is the dishonesty towards ourselves, which we consider part
of our moral code.  When you are not in a relationship it is permissible
to follow your biology.  You feel attraction and act accordingly,
perhaps within the confines of what is socially permissible, though such
constraints can be defied with ease.  But here is the catch: nature does
not care about social norms.  You will continue to feel attraction even
after you engage in a relationship.  Maybe to a lesser degree because
you feel more attracted to your original/current love.  Yet the point
stands.  Your body did not change all of a sudden, just because you
adopted this misbegotten notion that love falls within the domain of
private property.</p>

<p>You know what else is outside our control, just because nature does not
care about our vanity?  Findings ways to satisfy the instincts, such as
by conforming to the role of the romantic lover until you get laid.  For
that is what happens <em>all the time</em>.  Do you really believe that you
dinned together out of a common gastronomical interest that is an end in
itself?  Or that you spent half an hour looking at the swans in the pond
due to an inclination for ornithology or something?  How about those
sudden shifts in music preferences and the newfound interests in
literature and cinematography?  Yes, you guessed it.</p>

<p>Now let me generalise a bit, as this article is actually not about your
sexual adventures.  I do not care about you, nor will I come to your
party.  Where I am going with this is at the tendency human has to
consistently entertain false beliefs, despite piles of evidence to the
contrary.  Furthermore, it is baffling how we find it desirable to
maintain moral rules that directly contradict our nature.</p>

<p>Love is not the only area where we prefer to remain delusional.  Think
about the “true patriot” who dies on the battlefield to protect the
establishment, expecting the afterlife as a reward as well as post-death
recognition of their heroism.  How convenient it must be for the
extractive classes to perpetuate this idea that it is desirable to
disregard present injustices for a vastly superior life after life—and
heroes reserve a special spot there.  What?  You say it is an
unverifiable promise?  An expedient lie just to get things done and move
on?  Of course it is.  Like claiming that you will 100% love someone for
eternity and you will have eyes for no other.  Which is true until the
day it is not.</p>

<p>I would speculate that the fundamental reason for maintaining this
stance is our commitment to a rather strong version of free will.  You
act out of your own volition and must assume responsibility for the
consequences of your actions.  The stronger the type of free will a
society believes in, the greater the responsibility each choice carries.
Absolute freedom entails absolute responsibility; the reverse of which
is absolute punishment.  The reason I make this connection is because we
insist on preserving the perverse elements of our moral code.  The
belief is that we can defy nature exactly because of our free will and,
therefore, there can be no constraints on what our morality may demand.</p>

<p>Free will is perceived as this bastion of true self that kind of toils
against the forces of the natural order, the temptations, the instincts,
to maintain its truthfulness.  Which is to say that free will is
considered transcendent and that you are your true self regardless of
the world around you.  Variants of this worldview are the theories about
the body-soul divide, the eternity of the soul, reincarnation, the
afterlife, and so on.</p>

<p>Yet there is no indication whatsoever that there is a kernel of true
self that is immune to the forces of probabilistic cause and
effect. This is just whimsy perpetuated through the centuries.</p>

<p>Let’s get naive determinism out of the way: the inattentive observer
thinks that lighting a match and throwing it in a hay stack is the cause
of the resulting fire. In fact, there is a whole host of factors at
play, such as the level of humidity in the local atmosphere, the speed
of the wind, the condition of the hay and of the match so that both are
good fire conductors (e.g.  they are not wet), and so on.</p>

<p>Complex systems cannot be understood in simplistic linear terms of A
causes B. Same with humans. We are a function of internal processes and
external stimuli. The internal/external divide is conceptual, for the
system of interlinked factors we conceive as human organism is but a set
of emergent subsystems within the broader ecosystem, and so on. We may
not be able to draw a straight line from the original cause to the
epiphenomenon, say, the feeling of love. But we can study these
interconnected variables to discern patterns and draw further
conclusions. They are there, not in some spurious ‘domain’ of the
transcendent.</p>

<p>What we perceive as free will, the ability to choose and plan ahead,
might just as well be a dynamic function of feedback loops with possible
outcomes traced to said subsystems, which is not unique to humans as it
is found in animals and even plants.  At any rate, that is a matter of
objective research, not mystical mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>I call this bundle of beliefs on the ostensible transcendence of self,
the “decontextualised human”.  Conceived as a being as such, perhaps
trapped within an ephemeral vessel, but an absolute self nonetheless
that is not decisively influenced, indeed moulded and determined, by
their environment.  In this case, the environment also includes human
relations, for they too present external stimuli.  The decontextualised
human is one of our society’s most deep seated convictions, underpinning
everything from social policy, to the content of laws, the way courts
deliver justice, and prisons are organised.</p>

<p>Reconsidering our values would do us good.  Reduce the disconnect
between who we are and who we think we are.  No more stressing about our
inability to control forces that exist outside the purview of our “free
will” or social order in general.  No need to maintain this facade of
righteousness, the underlying hypocrisy of much of our moral code and
values.</p>

<p>Oh, you think you committed the same sin <em>again</em>.  You must be
admonished for your immorality!  But what if the very notion of
considering a natural condition sinful is the problem in the first
place?</p>

<p>Nature is. There is no good-bad divide therein. A realignment of
priorities and beliefs is in order.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>I am elated to be part of this society.  I feel honoured to be one of
them.  People here are righteous and honest.  Their actions are
perfectly aligned with their exhortations about the propriety of certain
kinds of behaviour.  They are fully devoted to this belief of theirs
that material things are ephemeral and that only the spirit matters.
Sometimes they call it “mind” or “soul”.  We understand it through this
inner agency of willfulness.  Basically, it amounts to this true self we
all have.  This transcendent presence that sets us apart from beasts,
plants, and the rest of the true self’s prison cell—what we call
“nature”.  They are refined people.  As their teachings go, they do not
attach value to their possessions, nor do they compete for scarce
resources.  These are pointless activities of lesser cultures.  My
people are different.  They truly have ascended, as their tradition
demands.  Now they just wait to move on the next domain of existence.</p>

<p>There are many personas in this social milieu that I venerate.  One that
stood out recently is the PhD holder.  That translates into <em>Philosophy
Doctor</em> in case you thought of something funny.  They stand up to this
title.  Their ability is peerless.  Their knowledge vast.  All of their
statements are precise, insightful, and unambiguous.  Their intentions
pure.  I find it remarkable how higher education, with the seemingly
disproportionate value it attaches to administrivia, can turn an
ordinary bloke into such a fantastic specimen of higher intellect.  It
truly is a wonder, akin to training a monkey into becoming a master
dialectician in the mould of Socrates.</p>

<p>As an aside, one should not use the term “administrivia”.  It might
carry negative connotations.  We do not want to imply that formal
education has a misplaced sense of pride and duty in its cumbersome
bureaucracy.  A more appropriate description is “criteria of
excellence”.  They ensure that fraudsters are kept away from
universities.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the case of this random fellow who submitted their
website as proof of their language skills.  Years of writing on
different topics.  As if that even comes close to having a language
certificate!  Thankfully, the people in charge outright reject the
uncertified.  They have programs in place which make it impossible to
even furnish something that would be subject to qualitative assessment.
Brilliant!  Fraudsters have all sorts of tricks up their sleeve.  They
might cheat their way into a Doctorate.  That would be the equivalent of
poisoning the well.</p>

<p>So no more “administrivia”.  My mistake!</p>

<p>Education of that highest order deserves all the accolades it can get.
For it delivers splendidly on its sole objective of emancipating people
from ignorance and prejudice.  Riches and reputation are petty concerns
among ignoramuses.</p>

<p>I would argue that we are in the PhD holder’s debt for their service to
society.  They instruct the rest of us.  Their mere presence inspires us
to the point where we need not act for ourselves.</p>

<p>Here is a case in point: a hotly contested topic is discussed on TV.  By
the by, “TV” in this society signifies “True Vision”, enlightenment.  It
has nothing in common with the junk food of information diet other
peoples get from their television.  Again, this society is different.
Back to the story then.  Politics is inherently controversial.  We all
have our views and predispositions.  Thankfully, there is the Philosophy
Doctor to resolve the tensions; tensions caused by ignorance.  Their
input in the discussion is catalytic.  They tell us their opinion and,
<em>bam</em>, as if by magic, we all assume this to be the default view.</p>

<p>And I note this phenomenon because there can be no other explanation as
to why years of study equip one to state the conventional wisdom in
slightly different terms.  It must be that we retroactively change our
view to match that of the Philosophy Doctor.  It <em>cannot possibly be</em>
that they are just acting as the intellectual vanguard of the
establishment.  No, that does not befit an exalted intellectual agent
such as the PhD holder you see on TrueVision.</p>

<p>And this why I truly love this society and would do everything within my
power to be of service to it.  Here social status is not about pretences
and titles.  It is about merit.  We <em>respect</em> the Philosophy Doctor.
Period.  It is not because of their awe-inspiring CV, remarkable though
it may be.  It also has nothing to do with their esoteric terminology
and tangle of conflicting meanings that can only hint at profoundness.
Don’t be silly.  We only value their wisdom, the very essence of their
Doctorate.  For that is what education endowed them with: not status,
just the prowess, nimbleness, and clarity of mind.</p>

<p>Now, to be perfectly honest, there are some naysayers, a fringe group,
who are suspicious of such personas.  They claim that a PhD is only
tangentially about science.  Most of it has to do with conditions
outside the realm of philosophy and research.  Such as competition
within the academic world.  Funding and their economic starting point.
Their conformity with the rules, norms and expectations of the powers
that be.  Their cultural background and how that influences people who
vouch for them.  And so on.  Those despicable nihilists even have the
temerity to suggest that they respect Philosophy Doctors—<em>Philosophy
Doctors</em>—only after they have proven their intellectual worth, never in
advance.  In other words, they do not care about the title; the title
that the highest and most noble of educations has bestowed upon them!!!</p>

<p>Such blasphemy.  Fortunately, I am not part of that lot.  I try to
emulate the good people in my society.  The honourable folks.  Learn
from them all the secrets of proper living.  Currently, I am working on
this unique skill where you mean something completely different than
what you state.  Usually the exact opposite.  That way you can preach
humbleness, humility, simple life, and the like, while ignoring the
minutiae, such as the fact that you have the most expensive car
possible—and not just one—, or that you accrue material possessions with
unparalleled obsession, or even that you boast about your achievements
in the workplace, by words and/or actions, and insist that your wealth
is proof of your <em>merit</em>.</p>

<p>This is the best aspect of this society.  It knows where its values are:
in what you say about yourself, not who you are.  Hence my infatuation
with its Philosophy Doctors on TV.  All of them!  This society has
decided to attach a special value to their very status as PhD holders.
That is what matters.  Ignore the naysayers.  Everything they do is in
vein, like having a healthy meal at a fast food restaurant.</p>

<p>The Philosophy Doctor speaks the truth.  We retrofit our conventional
wisdom to it.  And then the naysayers interpret this in reverse,
i.e. that, by and large, the PhDs are just parrots of their paymasters
or slightly less crude ignoramuses who repeat in chorus the absurdities
of some greater, more respectful, ignoramus.  Ha!  How foolish can you
be to not see the obvious.  The title is no coincidence.  They truly are
<em>Philosophy Doctors</em> and they guide us on the path to intellectual
ascendance.</p>

<p>To this end, I fully endorse this society’s binary thinking about
intellectual achievements.  You do not have a PhD?  Then you obviously
are an idiot, an oaf, a charlatan, a dishonourable opportunist, and must
also be a malevolent person and an eccentric, who defies the zeitgeist
and who openly questions the criteria of excellence this society has put
in place.  You do not hold a PhD, ergo you are no Philosophy Doctor.
You are a misguided moron for thinking that your opinion matters without
the rubber stamp of authority.  You are pathetic, as you have chosen to
speak your mind despite the fact that you are not a Philosophy Doctor
and cannot possibly have anything meaningful to add to society’s stock
of knowledge.  Shut up and accept what your ability—your <em>merit</em>—renders
possible.  Toil at the sweatshop for hours on end.  No, no talk.  No
thinking.  You cannot be inquisitive.  Get up and <em>do something</em>.  One,
two, one, two, one, two.  Up, down, sit, stay, heel.  Good!</p>

<p>I am the greatest proponent of this society and will answer the call to
defend it with alacrity.  Being a hero for this lot is a great
achievement.  It perpetuates it.  And I would do that.  For I truly
believe that the establishment’s power is derived solely from their
inner superiority.  Such meritocracy has to be upheld at all costs.
Less worthy beings, such as myself, who cannot fully grasp the workings
of this society can at least perform the honourable task of sacrificing
themselves for the rest to be allowed the freedom to advance the most
enlightened of civilisations.</p>

<p>Oh, but I cannot help but be reminded of those naysayers, insignificant
though they may be.  Their call is like a siren’s song.  Alluring, yet
deceitful.  They put up those posts: “heavy burdens on broader
shoulders”, “break the symbiosis between the state and the oligopolies”,
“bring back the real bread”, “homeland presupposes justice”, “patents
engender trolling, not innovation”, and similar fancies.</p>

<p>But I know better because I heard on TrueVision a Philosophy Doctor who
elaborated at length about the virtues of this society.  No, their
pontifications were not unfamiliar.  They were reformulating that which
the naysayers call “conventional wisdom”, embellishing it with their
oracular wisdom.  Only fools pay attention to the naysayers.  There is
no conventional wisdom.  We are buffoons by default.  The Philosophy
Doctor is performing an act of genuine altruism: that of moulding the
public opinion in the interests of enlightenment, of <em>Philosophy</em>, of
goodness for its own sake.  There are no ulterior motives whatsoever.</p>

<p>Here is why I am writing this: today I saw the light like never before.
But unlike the other people, it left me blind to pretenses.  Now I can
no longer believe in appearances.  They are meaningless.  I must touch
things to assess their verity.  Or at least have some objective means of
confirming their presence and of understanding their features.  This has
made me pedantic, some may say annoying and acerbic.  Impossible to work
with.  I feel no excitement about things as they are presented.
Fortunately I had the luck to have had prior experience of this society.
I already attained knowledge of the true value it attached to social
status, before this nagging tendency to ask for evidence and to question
conventions.  Today, it would be impossible to provide credence to the
advances of the Philosophy Doctor.  Imagine my predicament, my misery!
I was lucky to be indoctrinated.  Just as I have always been blessed to
be immersed in this milieu.</p>

<p>Make no mistake!  This society is <em>different</em>.  I can only pity the
naysayers who do not cherish what is given to them.</p>

<h2>Nihilism</h2>

<p>Now that you read the previous chapter, <em>Status</em>, let us switch gears.
Time to abandon the ironic tone and the hyperboles.  On with some
analysis.  While <em>Status</em> raises valid points, it obscures them in
nihilism.  The reader is not drawn to the arguments but to the overall
negativity.</p>

<p>Nihilism can be understood as a way of interpreting phenomena that is
characterised by the following connatural tropes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Binary thinking.</strong>  Everything is parsed through a rigid duality
with no space for permeations or permutations in between the extremes.</li>
  <li><strong>Forced homogenisation.</strong>  To fit into the mould of perfectly
symmetrical extremes, all things must be brought under a common
denominator.  Conceptual uniformity makes blanket statements possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Juxtaposition between the actual and the ideal.</strong>  Actuality is
compared to some ideal, only to be found wanting.  The ideal is, by
definition, perfect.  Reality is not.  Which results in a cycle of
self fulfilling negativity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach in <em>Status</em> conforms with these.  There is no nuance.  The
possibility of there being combinations of positive and negative
elements—with “positive” and “negative” being relative to the benchmark
used—is dismissed at the outset.  The topic under discussion is
presented in overly broad terms, so as to treat it as monolithic.  That
makes it possible to pass general judgements about it.  And, true to
nihilism, the overarching pessimism is the end product of deep seated,
yet misplaced idealism.  Things are not perfect, <em>therefore</em>, the
rationale is, they are absolutely terrible.</p>

<p>For instance, consider <em>Status’</em> statements against society’s hypocrisy.
Do they concern the entirety of society, some average, a select few?
Are they about everything society does, some aspects of collective
experience, or certain special cases?  And then, is this supposed
hypocrisy contingent on circumstances that condition the behaviour of
situational agents and patients?  Can there be instances where it is not
present?  Furthermore, is it true hypocrisy or a form of social
convention which remains consistent throughout and is not misunderstood
by the members of the social whole as something entirely different than
what it is supposed to be?</p>

<p>Nihilism adopts a scorched earth approach.  All or nothing, which all
too often means just the latter.  As such, the nihilist may be starting
from a sound or seemingly innocuous principle, say a lofty ideal, only
to ultimately work against it.</p>

<p>The nihilist inevitably becomes dogmatic.  For that is what the defence
of an absolute system of normative claims on reality entails.  They work
backwards from a conclusion.  This is to be contrasted with ideals that
derive from inquiry into the commonalities among the multitude of
phenomena.  The patterns, the abstract structure.  The nihilist’s ideals
are preconceived notions that are forced upon reality.  And the
nihilistic outburst is the expression of the inner realisation of the
conflict between one’s view of the world as it ought to be and the world
as it actually is and can be.</p>

<p>From a political perspective, the nihilist has no direct contribution to
make.  Extreme idealism can, at best, only keep a fringe group focused
on a narrowly defined task or utopia as an opposition force that will
never be in a position to implement its view.  Ideals are not
implementable as such.  Nihilism is the opposite of the capacity to
govern, as that presupposes the kind of practicality that recognises the
complexity of things, their heterogeneity, and the possibility of
incremental reforms that add up to a bigger change.  As such, the
nihilist is actually struggling between all that is ideal and nothing
that is real.  Which leaves them with the latter.</p>

<p>As for the theme of this book, human’s self worth, the nihilist
unwittingly becomes the agent of the most extreme form of human
exceptionalism.  This is typical among those who harbour nothing but
contempt for the world, as discussed in the first chapter of this book.
Now consider a less obvious example to reinforce the point: the
misguided Malthusian ecologist who truly believes that the planet’s only
hope is for humanity to go extinct.  They are assuming that they are the
most enlightened of the species, both because they are not preoccupied
with their own survival, as all living things, and due to humanity’s
ostensibly unique inability to adapt to evolving circumstances.
Furthermore, they commit the error of every other theory that subscribes
to the concept of the decontextualised human.  Humanity can be removed
from the ecosystem and everything else will remain in tact.  That is the
claim that humans are not inextricably bound up together with the rest
of the ecosystem.  Which is a weird view, to say the least, when it is
well known that removing any one of the species from its ecosystem will
disturb the local equilibrium, often with far-reaching ramifications.
This is where the dogmatic part of nihilism is fully fleshed out.  They
<em>just know</em>.</p>

<p>Nihilism is expressed as the posterior rationalisation of a deeply
rooted <em>conviction</em> that is unrealisable.  The real does not match the
ideal.  The ideal cannot be realised.  Crisis ensues and is then
justified as <em>certainty of nothingness</em>, either in a holistic sense, or
for the subject of inquiry.</p>

<p>Here are some common examples, with the proviso that they could be
classified as over-reactions that tend to normalise over time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “helpless romantic” who hates every one and every thing because
they are not worthy enough and cannot deliver true love.</li>
  <li>The armchair revolutionary who ultimately functions as an
anti-revolutionary by dismissing in advance every attempt at changing
things as either futile or as yet another concealed effort to preserve
the status quo.</li>
  <li>The naive Platonist who does not care about their hygiene or what
happens in the world in general, since everything is supposed to be a
fake representation of an unapproachable domain of absolute Forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key element of nihilism is not the view that nothing exists or that
nothing is real, etc.  But rather that they are certain of such a state
of affairs.  Unlike variants of scepticism, the nihilist can only posit
nothingness in the most dogmatic of ways as certainty of nothingness,
which itself would be a clear sign of <em>somethingness</em>.</p>

<p>The sceptic can speak about the lack of meaning or of the nonexistence
of various forms and categories of being, by following the analytical
method alluded to in the chapter about <em>Godlessness</em>.  The sceptic can
examine all available knowledge/literature over a given subject to
arrive at the conclusion that fundamental issues remain unresolved and
that none of the presences that precondition the field of research
concerned are, in fact, verifiable.  This would be an analytical
statement, not a conviction per se, but a reformulation of the stock of
available knowledge or a general characterisation derived therefrom.</p>

<p>An analytical proposition can provide insight into hitherto unseen
items, which would colloquially mean that we learn something new.  And
while that is a fair impression, analytics remain essentially
tautological.  We learn to represent—to reason, to talk about—the same
things in new ways, and may have a clearer understanding of their
abstract structure as a result.</p>

<p>The sceptic arrives at their position by studying what is “out there”
while inquiring into the meaning or the interplay between the subject
and the object.  The nihilist formulates their view of what should be
“out there” while claiming to know what is “in here”.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be fecund to posit nihilism as a type of
epistemological character; a defined way of dealing with episteme.  That
would make the comparison to scepticism more direct.  A nihilist tends
to express nihilistic views about every area or topic they are concerned
with.  They tend to be consistently nihilistic.  Much like a sceptic
tends to remain inquisitive and dubitative in every field of study.</p>

<p>Nihilism “puts the cart before the horse”, as the old adage goes.  They
get things in reverse, where reality must conform to the ideal and not
vice versa.  They misunderstand the role of ideals as (i) products of
thought derived by discerning the common in the multitude, and (ii) as
guides to human thought and action.  The ideal is treated as the enemy
of the good, rather than its general target.  Hence, the rejection of
every minute improvement or indication of positiveness, as decisively
inadequate or altogether a distraction that obscures the underlying
vanity of the whole venture, its worthlessness.</p>

<p>As for products of thought, it is worth addressing the Platonic notion
of Ideals in themselves.  The inescapable constraint imposed upon
Platonic Idealism, or on other theories that presume a decontextualised
“mind” or purely intellectual being, is that humans necessarily are part
of the world, experiencing it through the faculties their natural
condition has endowed them with.  There is no human qua purely
intellectual self, just as there can be no absolute “I think” without
connection to the underlying natural condition.</p>

<p>It may then be the case that pattern is immanent.  It is intrinsic to
things.  The fact that humans (and not only) can discern constants among
the variables that constitute the totality of input to the faculties of
sense and the intellect may just as well be because of a shared,
built-in capacity to identify commonalities in all that is, to
eventually abstract them and think of them as such.  That means to be in
a position to identify the “abstract structure”.  As such, universals
are not potentially recognisable by everyone because they must be
objectively present, but rather due to a common way of arriving at them
through the particulars.  A shared process of parsing information, if
you will.</p>

<p>This is where the nihilist errs lamentably.  The ideals they hold are
posited as objective categories that the world fails to comply with.
There is no means of easing this tension other than examining its basic
hypotheses.  And, if that proves inconclusive, then the only honest
conclusion is to recognise uncertainty for what it is and to remain open
to the possibility that it might cease to be upon further, more
comprehensive research.</p>

<p>Pedantic and inconsequential details for the dogmatists who have no time
for leaving things unanswered…</p>

<h2>Greens</h2>

<p>In politics we often see the terms “environment” and “ecosystem” used
interchangeably.  Same with “environmentalism” and “ecology”, and their
derivatives.  While the political process does not always require
precision of statement, it must be noted that the underlying values of
these terms differ profoundly.</p>

<p>Environmentalism is, in essence, a variant of anthropocentrism
(human-centrism).  Everything <em>environs</em> us.  Human is at the epicentre,
conceived as something different or somehow special compared to the rest
of nature.  This is an age-old tradition that has been reformulated and
embellished with new ideas throughout history from ancient mythology to
Humanism.</p>

<p>Even if only indirectly and despite whatever positives, anthropocentrism
has driven humanity’s incessant drive to exploit nature without
restraint.  Animals are raised in the equivalent of death camps, to be
slaughtered en masse, because they are “just animals”.  Plants are being
over-engineered to yield ever greater quantities of crops, with numerous
downsides to their own well-being and the sustainability of the other
species (economic oligopolies and the feudalism of the patent holders
notwithstanding), the health of the soil, as well as that of consumers.</p>

<p>In terms of first principles, the environmentalist does not want to
change the dynamic between humanity and the rest of nature.  Rather, the
focus is on some narrowly defined targets, secondary issues, such as
carbon emissions and the accompanying financial markets (carbon emission
trading).  In the same spirit, there is growing emphasis on economic
incentives to adapt to new methods of doing business, such as relying on
renewable energy, without changing the underlying assumptions and
aspirations of industrial production at large.  The entire system
covering everything from production-consumption-ownership is not
considered at fault, nor is it seen with suspicion.  Just keep track of
the carbon dioxide and similarly marketable snippets of ‘green
thinking’.</p>

<p>In contradistinction, the ecosystem includes humanity as yet another
factor of a broader whole.  Humans are no more special than grass, rats,
bees…  The uniqueness we want to attach to ourselves, such as our
relative intellectual superiority is, in truth, a difference of degree,
not category.</p>

<p>I guess a good analogy for understanding variations of this sort is to
think of life as akin to the output of the sound mixing console.  All
those sliders and rotary controls have to be fine tuned to produce a
specific sound.  A minor change modifies the output.  The more one
tinkers with the controls, the greater the degree of the change.  In the
same spirit, every instance of life can be conceived as the end product
of a specific set of combinations between an array of interrelated
factors.  Hence the differences in degree.</p>

<p>In the ecosystem everything is connected, for that is what “system”
means: a set of interlinked variables whose joint operation produces
local as well as emergent phenomena, which is governed by system-wide
and topical rules, and which sustains its operations endogenously.
Humanity cannot be without plants or other animals, or the kind of
weather equilibrium it has survived in, the specific arrangements of the
Earth’s and Moon’s orbits in relation to themselves and towards the Sun,
and so on.</p>

<p>Note here that “ecosystem” should be qualified as a set of subsystems,
each of which can be discernible in its own right.  So that we can speak
of the Earth’s ecosystem, or the ecosystem of a swamp, without having to
talk about the universe.  In the same way we can think of the human
organism—a human being—as such, without having to explain each time that
we are, in fact, referring to a set of subsystems all the way from the
atomic and molecular levels to the organs and to their interlinked
presence thereof.  Perhaps then, it is appropriate we find the correct
terms for each order of abstraction, though that might mean that we run
out of words depending on the degree of precision.  Or maybe we just use
qualifiers, such as the “Earth’s ecosystem”, “Europe’s ecosystem”, etc.
But I digress.</p>

<p>Humanity is nothing without the rest of the ecosystem.  The dichotomy
posited by environmentalists can only be entertained as one of
perspective, not ontology.  Which would, however, imply that the
meta-narratives of anthropocentrism are altogether dismissed, or at
least thoroughly reconsidered.</p>

<p>Let us entertain the latter possibility.  What would a revised self
image of humanity look like?  I think it should start by explicitly
making the environmentalist binary an arbitrary subject/object divide
based on our vantage point.  The ecosystem environs us in a literal
sense, without implications of any [mystical] difference of category.
Then, and even if we only care about ourselves, we must acknowledge the
fact that our very existence is contingent on there being a robust
ecosystem suitable to our presence and that of every life form that
flourishes together with, or alongside, us.  Which entails a whole host
of action programmes and necessary adaptations.</p>

<p>This, by the by, is not the same as deifying “mother nature”,
prohibiting any kind of interference out of some prejudice that me might
be disturbing the balance, or even expecting the rest of the species to
conform to human conventions (such as animal “rights”, which in truth
are human “obligations”).</p>

<p>While seemingly secular, the vision of the ecosystem as a superior
being, as the mother of all existence, rests on all sorts of baseless
assumptions.  As concerns the evident personification, we have no means
of knowing whether the ecosystem is <em>just</em> an aggregation of sub-systems
with emergent phenomena resulting from their interplay, or if it also is
a greater conscience or being whose inner mechanics we only experience
on the micro scale as seemingly inanimate systems (same with how atoms
do not exhibit consciousness—as far as we know—but humans, who are made
of atoms, do).</p>

<p>Such speculation does not really change the parameters of the debate on
which anthropocentrism rests.  It just shifts the focus, or reformulates
the narrative.  Instead of an extra-cosmic god qua grand architect, as
in biblical tradition, we have an ever-present, yet still
anthropomorphic or animal-like, ubiquitous source of life.</p>

<p>These theories are not mutually exclusive and do not prejudice the
possibility that we develop an anthropocentric worldview that is
consistent with them, such as humanity being the chosen child of mother
nature, whereby the human soul has a transcendent presence that is not
found in the rest of the species in order to fulfil some higher
objective, etc.</p>

<p>The specifics will take us on a tangent.  Our imagination is the only
limit here and it can keep us writing for the rest of our life.  The
point is that anthropocentrism is, at its root, a theological account.
Whether the theology is of one kind or another does not change this
basic fact.</p>

<p>The problem with all theology is what I alluded to in the chapter about
<em>Godlessness</em>, namely that its claims cannot be verified in an objective
manner.  Theology is like a game of luck where all numbers win.
Everyone can have their own theory and they may all claim to be correct,
as none can ever be proven right or wrong.</p>

<p>Overcoming anthropocentrism is about grounding human’s sense of self in
a narrower set of principles.  While the task may seem daunting, it is
surprisingly simple and boils down to this: stick to the facts.  The
humanity/environment distinction is one of perspective.  Human presence
is contingent on there being an ecosystem.  Beyond those, the problem
with anthropocentrism is not about the way it is framed, but its
political implications.</p>

<p>The human world is inherently complex.  International economics,
finance, and monetary affairs are too much for one person to grasp in
the fullness of their scale.  Let alone the interplay between the
multitude of decentralised actors, the implications of diverging
cultural-historical path dependencies of the various peoples, the unique
features of each society, both in terms of social structures and
political institutions, and so on.</p>

<p>Amid this bewildering complexity, one can be excused of forgetting that
principles are always simple.  It is their implementation or
particularisation that introduces complexity.</p>

<p>For instance, the entire world could function within a single,
overarching constraint, which we may call the <em>principle of
sustainability</em>.  Whether it is finance, or fiscal policy, or the
conduct of war, everything has to be gauged in terms of its capacity to
remain contained to its subject matter before it creates deleterious,
spill-over effects that would prevent a return to the previous state of
affairs.  If any one of human’s fields of endeavour becomes
unsustainable, it produces a cascade of catastrophic consequences which
can, at the extreme, lead to our annihilation or, at the very least, to
its discontinuation.</p>

<p>Think of sustainable warfare, as tasteless as that term may be.  We
cannot nuke each other into oblivion.  That guarantees the destruction
of the planet and our annihilation.  In this sense, the end of war is
only brought about by absolutely total war.</p>

<p>What about sustainable finance?  The only reason the global economic
system remains in place is because it has yet to reach peak saturation.
It still finds outlets to release the pressure, as it were, and thus
survives its cyclical shocks/crises.  It survives by identifying new
areas to exploit and to rollover the problem; a problem that is
incrementally aggrandised, yet whose burden continues to be shifted
around so that it remains less obvious.  Whatever calamities, poverty,
austerity, precarity, mass economic migration, are contained to various
segments of human society or geographic locales that seem to change
periodically.  The system as such is yet to reach a terminus, at which
point it will no longer be sustainable in the sense of merely being
capable of continuing (so not “sustainable” in the normative sense of
desirability for society—it is well beyond that, though that is an issue
of extractive classes exploiting the masses of people the world over,
which is a major political challenge, though not necessarily one that
concerns ecology as such).</p>

<p>And so on for every other human activity.</p>

<p>To this end, the ‘green’ themes are in need of a rethink.  For it is not
the underlying theology that is at stake here.  Nor is the problem about
turning “black industry” (production powered by fossil fuel) into “green
industry” (production powered by renewable energy), or conforming to a
target for carbon emissions.  While important in their own right, these
are secondary issues in the grand scheme of things.  This is about
refactoring the entire framework of values pertaining to
production-consumption-ownership.  And that involves everything from the
distribution of resources, the way costs and the externalities of waste
are handled, the degree to which private property is considered
untouchable, the narrowing of the scope of intellectual property and
patents, the decentralisation of economic activity and the concomitant
devolution of political authority to the local level.</p>

<p>As such, ecology is only tangentially about reformulating the narrative
about human’s self worth.  This is a matter of deciding between a
political order that, by and large, satisfies the interests of the few
more than those of the many, or a new order that does not produce
winners and losers in accordance with the self perpetuating “winner
takes it all” mentality.</p>

<p>What ‘green’ themes introduce is another aspect to this ever pertinent
debate.  That the power balance within human society also depends on
actions or phenomena that seem to have no direct effect on humanity.</p>

<p>Couched in those terms, revaluing our self image, so that we are no
longer some unique ‘essence’ that is distinct from the rest of the
ecosystem, may just be the first step in the long road of reviewing our
politics and the deep seated assumptions that fuel them.</p>
