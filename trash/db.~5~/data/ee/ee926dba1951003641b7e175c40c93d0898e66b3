         <p>In this video I talk at length about the official release of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/pdfd">Prot’s
Dots For Debian</a> (PDFD) and the code base
it deals with.  This is a free/libre book that allows you to reproduce
my custom desktop session, while offering detailed information on the
various facets of my setup.</p>

<p>Consider this a primer on my BSPWM.  By watching it, you should have
a general idea of what is going and how the various programs are put
together.  I cover everything from the basics to some advanced topics.
I also offer a short guide on Tmux, the terminal multiplexer that is an
integral part of my daily workflow.</p>

<p>Kindly note that Debian 10 ‘Buster’ officially releases on July 6, 2019
(today is July 2, 2019).  I have decided to publish my work slightly in
advance to make sure that everything works as expected.  If you are
eager to follow the steps in PDFD, please wait just a little bit longer.</p>
