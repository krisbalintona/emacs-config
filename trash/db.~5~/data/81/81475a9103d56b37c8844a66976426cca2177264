<p><strong>A.:</strong> You missed yesterday’s party…</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Yeah, it happens.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I tried to contact you yesterday and this morning, but you never
replied.  It has been a long time since you last joined us.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I didn’t want to be there and didn’t feel like I had to explain
myself.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You don’t like our company or parties in general?  I mean… You
are here.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> We need to define who “our” company is.  Is that you or a random
collection of strangers?  As for parties, they typically consist of
people with little to no connection to each other.  I never got anything
out of them.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You don’t like strangers then?  To me this is the best thing
about parties, especially in this cosmopolitan city.  You get to meet
new people from diverse backgrounds.  All these cultures coexisting
peacefully.  It is a treasure!</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I guess this is where my problem starts: parties do not allow
you to actually get to know someone.  You grab a drink and chat with the
person next to you about whatever superficial topic comes up.  After the
Nth time of being asked about the latest events on some TV show that I
have never watched or ever showed interest in, I feel those
conversations are a complete waste of my time.  I don’t even have a TV,
but the random fellow nearby does not know that as they do not know me.
They just assume things, putting me in a defensive position where I need
to explain every little deviation from their preconceived notions.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Maybe you just expect immediate results.  It does not work that
way.  Sure, you have no interest in chit-chat though that is nothing
more than an introduction.  Once you break the ice, things start flowing
naturally and you get to know the other person and have a good time.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> It could be that, though I tried multiple times to get past the
awkward phase.  I would listen to what they have to say, ask them some
question based on what I learnt from them and gradually work my way
towards something closer to my interests or at least something that
could be generalised to find applications beyond the specifics of the
topic under consideration.  You know me: I am very patient and an active
listener.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> That could be the issue right there: people may think you are
almost interrogating them.  They are not used to someone actually
listening to what they say.  Most of the times they just talk past each
other, as if they are not collocated, bouncing words off of some
imaginary barrier between them.  They stand next to each other, but they
are not together.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> And this is why I feel I am being put in a defensive position.
This is who I am, yet that type of person does not conform with others’
expectations.  I need to explain to them that I am listening carefully
to what they have to say and am contributing to the discussion with
relevant questions.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You need to learn how to switch topics.  Those probing questions
stress them out in a subtle way: they are not prepared for them, they
are not ready for that level of scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Switching topics has not worked for me.  It simply rolls the
problem over to the next theme.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You cannot go in-depth again, right?  Care to offer an example?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> It was at your birthday party: I don’t understand why you
celebrate birthdays, but I digress.  I had just walked indoors and was
perusing the bar with the drinks.  This girl came up to me while I was
trying to grab a beer and asked me what the differences between the
brands were.  I explained that one is an ale, another is a lager, etc.,
and then went on to outline their main differences in taste and texture.
Then she asked me what brought me to this place, to which I replied that
I was your guest and we have been friends for years.  So I asked back
“what about you?”.  She told me that she was a colleague of yours from
the office.  Then she tried to steer the discussion towards the kind of
stuff I have grown to dislike, at which point I interrupted her saying
bluntly that I find chit-chat boring, bordering on annoying, and if she
was still curious to consider something else, something perhaps more
interesting.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Well, it seems to me you are good at this.  You know how to
listen and to talk, and you have knowledge of all those things which
others might treat as useful trivia, at the very least.  I can’t
understand your problem then.  You start off with some generic topic and
then the discussion follows from there.  Nice and simple.  What about
this story then?  How did things go?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I asked her instead to tell me about her background: what did
she study, if anything, what were her interests related to that, and so
on.  She told me she had a degree in business administration but went on
to pursue anthropological themes, doing work in different parts of the
world.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Oh, I know who that is!</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Of course you do.  To the story: I don’t care about business but
I am interested in anthropology, so I went on with that.  At my request,
she told me what she had learnt from those peoples and how “we” could
help them out in this or that way.  After she had described the
situation, I invited her to put aside her enthusiasm of helping others
and first try to figure out what she had learnt about herself and her
own culture by being exposed to those peoples.  She paused for what felt
like a full minute, perplexed and bedazzled: it must have been an odd
proposition.  I did not take my eyes away and did not try to change
topics: I was communicating my commitment to that statement.  It seemed
to trouble her though not in the sense of being disturbing but as the
kind of question that had never occurred to her.  I felt that she had
never pondered that “we”—whoever that is—do not have all the answers
and are not necessarily better than them, with all qualifiers of what
“better” even means in such a case.  I took it as an opportunity to
nudge her to look inwardly and improve herself.  I interrupted the pause
with a remark: “how can you help a group of people you do not truly
understand and, more importantly, how can you help
someone—anyone!—when you are not sure who you are and whether you
can even help yourself?”</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Oh my… What was her answer?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> She had no answer.  Sipped some beer and checked whether I
wanted to dance with her…</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> So it worked!  You did it, my friend!</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> No, it didn’t because I was expecting an answer or at least
another opportunity to further explore those concepts.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You did not dance?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Idiot! I swear, sometimes your behaviour baffles me even after
all this time of being with you.  It is preposterous.  You passed on a
perfect opportunity, you fool!</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> This is where I am getting at.  Dance is a form of expression,
which I appreciate in its own right.  Yet, in the context of a party it
carries with it specific connotations.  It has a certain function of
socialisation beyond the aesthetics of the art itself.  It is the same
as with bending the knee to authority: if I do it here, it might cause
laughter, but if I were to do it in front of royalty, it would express
much more than the act itself, including recognition of the cobweb of
institutions that grant royals their power.  To my point though.  What
is the value of sociability if I cannot communicate?  What is a
connection without a link?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> But you can flirt and have a good time!  There is a place for
everything.  Now we have the chance to hold a serious discussion.  It is
a nice evening, the sky is clear and we drink herbal tea.  We never do
any of that on Saturday nights.  At parties we dance and just enjoy
ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> You are hinting at social roles.  The assumption is that we are
all supposed to be the same in that regard.  To act a certain way that
conforms with the expectations that are fastened upon the concept of the
event: “at parties we dance” is one way of formulating such a construct.
There are those who express themselves in words, others with pictures,
others still through their performance.  And there are combinations and
permutations between the extremes.  You need to disaggregate people and
treat each one of them on their own merits.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Don’t you agree though that there is this notion of “the right
place at the right time”?  You cannot expect the same results between
contexts that differ profoundly from one another.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> That is true.  My point is that the context does not remake
people: it changes the scope of the permissible, the desirable.  It
frames behavioural patterns.  Think of it this way: you never see anyone
walking up to a table and asking someone for a dance in this place at
this time.  It is inappropriate, unexpected, undesirable.  That is what
the context does.  Put the same people in a different setting, say, a
night club and the roles change.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> What is a person then?  If we can only ever learn about someone
and thus ourselves through actions and if all actions are bound by some
structural, else extra-personal magnitudes, then the person is a
function of the case’s constitution.  How would we go about establishing
an identity, a constant that transcends those ever evolving states of
affairs?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> The self consists of two magnitudes: those that are
mind-dependent and those which are mind-independent.  <em>Chrēmata</em> and
<em>pragmata</em>.  The former are brought into being, or are assigned a
defined purpose through rules or conventions, while the latter are
facts.  We can think that “on Saturday nights we dance”, just as we can
agree to another stipulation: “we do not dance on Saturday nights”.
This value is chrēmatic: it rests in usage.  There is nothing inherent
in Saturday nights that causes the need or the expectation of dancing.
Whereas we cannot do that for the Sun.  Not even if all humans agree to
it, we cannot institute the Sun into its opposite.  It is there
regardless of our intentions and aspirations.  It is unrefashionable.
Couched in those terms, I would suggest that the person has an
underlying nature, a pragma, that is like the Sun: it is a fact.  We
notice it with people’s physical characteristics, for example.  One is
tall, another has broad shoulders, a third has blue eyes, etc..  Why not
extend that to people’s inner world?  Each of us has their own
character.  Some are emotional, others are calculative, more still are
people-oriented, while others enjoy solitude and quietude.  Just as we
cannot turn a tall fellow into a short one by means of institution, we
cannot make an introvert fully gregarious and outgoing.  And so on.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> So institutions are kind of arbitrary while nature is the only
truth?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> No, not necessarily.  Everything we do is contingent on our
nature.  We can only realise what is within our potentiality.
Institutions contribute to an emergent reality that is not to be found
in each one of us individually.  The dichotomy I introduced is meant as
an analytical device when applied to the human condition, whose purpose
is to educate us; to help us make sense of the case.  In practice, we
cannot separate layers of the human being, the culturally and socially
constructed being, into physical and emergent: the pragmatic and
chrēmatic are interconnected in a singular reality.  To your point,
institutions form part of a network of meanings.  Their world is one of
communication, in the sense that it is intersubjective and thus hinges
on exchanges between people.  Think of language, for instance.  It is in
our nature to produce sounds, use gestures, and make facial expressions
with which to engage in a feedback loop of sharing and receiving ideas
or expressing emotions.  If someone you care about stares deeply into
your eyes, pauses for a while and then says “I love you!” in a specific
tone of voice and with a given set of non-verbal expressions, that
carries a different colelction of significations than a computer reading
out those exact words.  The computer does not understand meaning because
it does not feel anything in that combination of letters: it has no
experience of what the resulting sounds refer to and it cannot discern
emotion and intent.  It is not the words that hold the meaning, but
their communicative utility as understood by those involved.  A hug can
have the same meaning as that phrase.  While another hug can be a mere
formality, like a handshake with a coworker.  Institutions are bundles
of meaning.  They operate just like that, only they target classes of
people.  Think, for instance, of a social norm of allowing the elderly
to have priority in the waiting line at the grocery store.  One may
argue that this is arbitrary because society just wants to be polite,
politically correct, or whatnot.  Though we can still trace the
underpinnings of the institution back to some underlying natural
condition, as the norm implies that we recognise age-related physical
differences and are willing to show compassion and mitigate inequalities
that would otherwise arise, by introducing a positive element of
discrimination: to slightly favour the elderly over the youth in an
attempt to even out the differences between the two groups.  So no,
arbitrariness does not seem inherent to institutions.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Now take me back to the section in our discussion where we
considered the sense of context when dealing with people.  I claimed
that there is a right place and a right time for certain patterns of
behaviour and then simplified that with the expression “on Saturday
nights we dance”.  You then countered that such is a tacit attempt at
homogenisation or, at least, that it does not account for innate
differences between people.  Fair enough!  I get that.  What I do not
understand quite as well is the linkages you are trying to draw between
context-dependent action and the account of the human condition and its
intersubjectivity.  Why is it so difficult to follow that girl to the
dance floor?  Did you not fancy her?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Once you are at that point, it is not difficult at all.  I could
have.  No objection there.  And no, it is not a matter of fancy either.
Though that story is nothing but a narrative I spun based on partial
information in an attempt to frame my thesis and make it relatable.  It
is not about any given person.  It may be a woman, a man, a <em>Fata
Morgana</em> I experienced while staring at the horizon.  Who knows?  It may
not even be rooted in a real story, yet it does not matter even if
everything about it is true, down to the last detail which shall remain
private anyway.  You know me and can tell what is the case, but ignore
that.  What I am trying to flesh out is the phenomenon of temporary
depersonification that stems from the expectations associated with the
given context: the party, the drinks, the girl, the music, the
invitation to the dance floor…  They call for a given type of person
and a specific modus operandi.  Some may be like that independent of the
context, others will have to fake it.  They must act laboriously in
accordance with the implicit rule book of the setting.  And so B. must
appear as non-B. for the purposes of fitting in.  Why must that happen?
Because failure to do so results in people thinking of you as a weirdo.
Acting unlike oneself is a self-defence mechanism to fend off that kind
of offensive.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Doesn’t that mean you still care about what others think and are
always in a process of acting?  If you don’t care and wish to just be
yourself, you do whatever you want and stop complaining about social
expectations.  No?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Indeed, you do what you want, as in not walking to the dance
floor to accompany the girl.  But here is how pressure builds up: she
will tell her friends of that event and they may conclude that B. is
eccentric.  Maybe they will hypothesise about B.’s sexual orientation or
imagine some background story that caused that particular behaviour.
Depending on how invested they are, they might seek to know more and
paint a picture that fits their narrative.  You can’t help that: it is
normal for people to be curious about those kinds of things.  So next
time you meet her or her circle of acquaintances, you will sooner or
later have to confront those assumptions.  “Is she not your type?”, “Why
were you sad that day?”, “If you need help, I am here for you!”, “I can
arrange for her to come join us if you feel like it!”, and so on.  You
just want to mind your own business, but you can’t because of the
mechanics of intersubjectivity.  You did not invite any of that.  You
just wanted to do what made you comfortable at the moment.  Even that
simple act cannot prevent the depersonification I alluded to earlier,
for B. has already become non-B. in the others’ impression of B. and
B. is now called to apologise for being something other than what
B. truly was when those events transpired.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> So you don’t call me when I invite you to a party because you
want to avoid the consequences.  I respect that.  Just wanted to know.
Though, as you said, you could just tag along as a means of self-defence
and—who knows!—maybe you would forget that you had assumed a role
and simply had a great time.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> It is not only the interpersonal effects, here understood as
consequences.  We must also consider the person itself and how this
inevitable social pressure contributes to uneasiness.  It will help
explain the difficulty with acting, which is another way of admitting
how tedious it is to always be on the defensive.  Yes, you can suspend
belief once or a few times, but doing it at all times in all cases
distorts who you are.  Now I am friendly with everyone, now I enjoy
gossip, now I blithely accept your invitation to yet another party with
a bunch of strangers, now I dance ever so cheerfully, now I show how I
fancy this girl.  Look at me!  Just look, else you will miss the show I
am putting up!  All I am doing is layering one mask on top of another.
Who am I?  Who is this phantasmagorised self?  Can I even remember how
my face looks like after every look into the mirror reveals whatever
mask is appropriate for that setting?  Will I despair when I can no
longer tell when I am role-playing?  Might I feel stressed if I cannot
determine whether I am wearing a mask or not, and whether that is the
right one for the occasion?</p>

<p>[ Read: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-04-15-role-actuality/">On role and actuality</a> (2021-04-15) ]</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Too many rhetorical questions there.  What are you trying to
say?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I suspect there is a mechanism, or concerted effort of multiple
related mechanisms manifesting as a singular one, that keeps us tied to
the underlying reality of our self.  Think of it like a boat and an
anchor.  The boat can float in any given direction, but is ultimately
pulled back to the anchor’s location.  The self can be swayed by
instituted realities up to a degree, though it can never become its
non-self.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> What happens if you try to pull up the anchor?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Say you can do that.  Which direction should you then move
towards?  And once you get there, won’t you want to be anchored in that
place?  The gist is that wherever we find ourselves at any given point
in our life, we are always framed, determined, or otherwise influenced
by the <em>pragmatic</em> (mind-independent) aspect of our self, the
environment notwithstanding.  We speak of muscle memory and we know that
the lungs cannot turn into a liver, the eye does not become an ear, and
so on.  Every single one of the subsystems that makes up the supersystem
we discern as the human organism exhibits this commitment to identity,
this insistence on self.  Every fibre of our being works that way.  So
when you try to act unlike your self, you effectively do something akin
to eating a food you are allergic to: your body reacts negatively.  It
harms you.  Now I would posit that what we call the psyche is not a
distinct quantity from the totality of the human supersystem, in the
sense that it is not unaffected by the rest of the factors that are in
an interplay with it.  The negative reaction, in our case, can thus be
experienced solely as an undesirable emotion, like anxiety, or a
psychological condition such as depression.  There will always be
tension resulting in longer-term damage when you cannot recognise your
actuality.  Your being actively resists becoming something alien to it.
That contradiction, that friction manifests as frustration, sadness,
illness.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Is there no way you can find a balance?  What you describe here
seems to me that it can only lead to isolation.  You don’t join our
parties, which I am fine with: I will continue to invite you to be sure
that you do not think I forgot about you.  You don’t hang out with
colleagues after work, because you want to escape from that role as soon
as possible…  You are a recluse.  Where do you get the chance to relax
and be who you are?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> The more you think about it, the harder it gets.  Every place
comes with its own set of rules of conduct.  Those may be tacit or
tolerable, but they are there.  Here I am myself, unencumbered by false
wants and expectations.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> How do you know that you are not acting again?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I am relaxed.  There is no pressure, no sense of inner conflict.
If I am still acting, which I probably do such as by observing basic
manners, I am not being alienated from who I am.  The act is harmless,
the role carries no expectations that can force me to refashion myself.
So it is the kind of rules that are linked to an operation of
depersonification that I am concerned with.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Your problem is with expectations and desires that demand a
change from your side…</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Yes, it is the desire of the unattainable, the yearning of the
unrealisable that forces you into submission.  Not outright.  It undoes
you piecemeal.  When you role-play you get into the mode of trying to
pursue an end you ultimately do not want.  You are essentially forced to
do it contrary to your volition, only you rationalise it as your will.
You have been trained to behave in such a manner in anticipation of some
reward, such as getting the chance to be with that girl you only just
met, or to generally enjoy a good reputation of sociability among your
peers.  You are essentially accumulating credit points that you exchange
for the favourable opinions of others.  Until you realise that this
peculiar currency, just like money, fiat or otherwise, has no intrinsic
value and is useless in and of itself, while the ‘goods’ it can buy are
themselves of dubious value as they are ephemeral.  Put simply, you harm
yourself by becoming non-you in exchange for some short-term
satisfaction.  What you get in return for role-playing is, at its best,
just like consuming sugar: it is uplifting at the moment, despite being
deleterious over the long-term.  And since I have long quit eating
sugar, I can do the same with inputs to my body, my sense of self
at-large, that are sugar-like in their effects.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Is there a type of social activity you are comfortable with?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Plenty!  Basically everything where I do not have to apologise
for what I do.  I should not be explaining my actions.  Gather the lads
and let’s go play football.  The more the merrier!  Eleven-a-side.  And
if we get some new folks to join us, that is even better because we add
an element of unpredictability to our game.  I love that stuff!</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Your problem is not with strangers then, nor with meeting new
people, not even with being sociable per se.  What is it exactly?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Hypocrisy: banal, innocuous, spontaneous hypocrisy.  Though not
in itself, but in light of social expectations.  One’s hypocrisy, of the
sort here considered, renders them an avatar in the others’ game world.
The disconnect between the person and the persona is what troubles me.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Have you ever doubted your conclusions?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I have done so many times.  At first, I would just go with the
flow.  The more I became aware of myself, the greater the challenge of
handling social pressure.  When I noticed the tension, I rationalised it
as awkwardness on my part and I would apologise for it, coming up with
excuses such as that I was tired, had not eaten well…  You get the
idea.  Then I subjected that attitude to closer scrutiny and found it
wanting.  There was no awkwardness and no need to ever apologise.  I am
who I am.  It is a fact, of the <em>pragmatic</em> sort, just like the Earth’s
orbit around its star.  Self-doubt is what led me to where I currently
am.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> What would you say, then, if I told you that this otherwise
elaborate analysis of yours could be just a hardened carapace that
protects your sensitive innermost parts?  Might it hide some insecurity?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> That could be the case.  Though I have thought about this for
too long and have gone back and forth with my opinions on the matter.
Perhaps this insecurity is a deep-seated one, so tightly embedded in my
core that it feels practically inseparable or indistinguishable from it.
Maybe this is hypocrisy of another sort: of whispering lies to yourself
to remove the sense of uneasiness.  An intricate tale of half-truths
woven together with suppressed desires and/or phobias that you want to
believe is true.  A curated image of self.  Oh the irony of the Gods!
All the reasoning, all the theorising…  Maybe all of it is but a
placebo, a substitute for true understanding; an understanding that must
start from the non-rational, the non-theoretical, the non-verbal.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> And what would that be?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I don’t know.</p>
