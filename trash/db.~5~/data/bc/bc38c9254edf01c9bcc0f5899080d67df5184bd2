         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate the main uses of <code>recentf</code>.  This is a
package that is built into Emacs.  It stores a list of the most
recently-visited files, allowing us to access them directly even if they
are no longer stored in a buffer.</p>

<p><code>recentf</code> can interface with <code>ido-mode</code> to either improve the selection
of items from the list or to treat them as “virtual buffers”.  The
latter means that recent files are available through the standard
buffer-switching command (by default bound to <code>C-x b</code>).  They are
treated as if they were actual buffers.  Super convenient!</p>

<p>And this is a link to my configuration file, with all the settings I
showed in the video as well as everything else from previous screen
casts: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>
