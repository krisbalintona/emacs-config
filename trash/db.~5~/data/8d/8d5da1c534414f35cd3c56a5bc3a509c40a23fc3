         <p>In this video I demonstrate some of the ‘hidden’ or perhaps <em>less
obvious</em> features of Ivy.  I also talk about my customisations and their
underlying rationale.</p>

<p>You are free to copy whatever you want concerning Ivy or all the rest
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">from my dotemacs</a>.</p>

<p>My themes are on MELPA.  Search for <code>modus-operandi-theme</code> for the light
version or <code>modus-vivendi-theme</code> for the dark one.  Check the git <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes">repo
of the Modus theme</a> for
more information.</p>
