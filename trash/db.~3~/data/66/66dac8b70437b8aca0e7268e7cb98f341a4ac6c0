         <p>In this screen cast, I offer an overview of SXHKD, the “Simple X Hotkey
Daemon”.  This is a program that stores custom key bindings.  We use it
to control the window manager, as well as launch other arbitrary
processes</p>

<p>I use <code>sxhkd</code> in tandem with my tiling window manager: <code>bspwm</code>.  These
two programs have been developed by the same person: Bastien Dejean.</p>

<p>The demo is based on the configurations that are bundled with the rest
of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.</p>
