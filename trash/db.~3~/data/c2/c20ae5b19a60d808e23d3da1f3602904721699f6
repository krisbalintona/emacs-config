         <p>In this video I present an implementation of <code>append-to-buffer</code>.  This
is an Emacs function for accumulating text (one of many).  I combine
it with the power of a keyboard macro, window switching, and the
built-in shell prompt (<code>shell</code>), to ultimately run a Bash script in a
loopâ€”a real productivity boost.</p>

<p>Please note that the lag I experience while executing the macro is due
to my underpowered hardware and the conditions I am recording in.  My
sincere apologies!</p>

<p>Though not relevant to the demo, here is my Emacs configuration file:
