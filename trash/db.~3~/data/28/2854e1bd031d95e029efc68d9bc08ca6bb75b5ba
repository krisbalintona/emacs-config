         <p>In this short video I explain how I was able to discover two
<em>undocumented</em> functions of <code>dired-subtree</code>, which define a toggle and a
cyclical behaviour for expanding or contracting a subdirectory inside of
Dired.  I also discuss how to use the built-in methods of Emacs to
discover such hidden features.</p>

<p>And this is a link to my configuration file, with all the settings I
showed in the video as well as everything else, from previous screen
casts: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>
