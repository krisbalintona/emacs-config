         <p>In this video tutorial I offer an introduction to Emacs’ special
compartments for storing data, called “registers”.</p>

<p>Use them to save text, numbers, positions, window or frame
configurations.  They are very powerful and can boost your productivity
in various scenarios, such as when recording a keyboard macro.</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for the section I
have on registers (and for everything else, of course).</p>
