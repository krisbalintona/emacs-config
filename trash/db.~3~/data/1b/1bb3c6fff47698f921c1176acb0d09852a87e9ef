         <p>In this screen cast, I present a new script I wrote that compares the
contrast ratio between two colours.  The script is called CLR
(conveniently pronounced as “colour”), which stands for “Check
Luminance Ratio”.</p>

<p>The code of CLR makes heavy of Bash parameter expansion.  It helps me
practice some of my shell scripting skills.</p>

<p>In the screen cast I also offer a primer on colours in the RGB space and
talk a little bit about accessibility.</p>

<p>CLR is part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
and is licensed under the GPLv3 (as is the rest of the code).</p>
