         <p>In this video I show how to use the built-in file manager of Emacs
(dired == directory editor) to change file permissions for multiple
items.  This is yet another clear case where <code>dired</code> proves its utility.</p>

<p>Given the topic of this video, I also offer a primer on file permissions
in Linux (I do not know how it works on other operating systems).</p>

<p>Though not related to this demo, here is the link to my
