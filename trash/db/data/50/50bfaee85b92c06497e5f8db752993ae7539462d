<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This book represents an attempt to analyse and in some ways interpret
sovereignty. What it is. Its factors and scopes. The shortcomings of its
mainstream conception. The distinction between its headline presence and
the effective control over the means of governance.</p>

<p>Sovereignty is one of the fundamental concepts of modern political
thinking. It also is the one most likely to be revised in light of
developments in international relations, the integration of global and
regional trade, advances in information technology, and the emergence of
cyber as the irreducible factor of many an activity and social
experience.</p>

<p><em>Essays on Sovereignty</em> (hereinafter also referred to as “Essays” or
“this/the book”) is for the most part a piece of political theory. The
very subject matter demands as much. Theoretical discourse is informed
or complemented by insights from political conduct and economics, while
it draws on my more content-focused understanding of European Union
politics, as well as my second field of venture as a front end web
developer.</p>

<p>Some chapters of this book feature sections with an outright
philosophical outlook. Others incorporate day-to-day political issues
into the analysis. The result is a piece of work that stands somewhere
in between intermediate and advanced studies into the topics under
examination.</p>

<p>The reader is expected to have a solid understanding of such items as
international relations, the notion of self-determination,
globalisation, and the like. They are also assumed to be aware of
everyday political events and their significance. Such information is
necessary for drawing linkages between the immediate effects of the
political process and their underpinnings as these are studied herein.</p>

<p>Reading the <em>Essays</em> may be seen as having a multiplying
effect. Theoretical work can broaden one’s horizons. To see the
theretofore unseen. revaluate the given. Connect pieces of information
that appeared to be unrelated. Be inspired into pursuing a new research
programme. In short, theory guides one to think differently. That in
itself can have benign implications on a whole series of thoughts and
dispositions.</p>

<p>The minimum you should expect to gain from this book is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Actuality.</strong> A distinction between headline and effective
sovereignty.</li>
  <li><strong>Application.</strong> A decoupling of the magnitudes of sovereignty and
nationality.</li>
  <li><strong>Extent.</strong> A broader view of sovereign authority as pertains to its
contributing factors and overall context.</li>
</ul>

<p>The writing of this book is an investment of sorts. It sets aside
resources (time and effort) to tackle a series of recurring themes in a
consistent and systematic fashion. The end product will then stand as a
point of reference or basis for other projects, including analyses of
political phenomena as they emerge. My hope is that it will perform a
similar function for those who read it.</p>

<p>To that end, the book’s availability should also be mentioned. It is
distributed <em>free of charge</em>. It will be available on this website for
you to read online or <a href="https://protesilaos.com/sov/print/">get your print
copy</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the <em>Essays</em> is in fact just that: a collection of
articles linked together by a common theme. Each chapter is written as a
more or less standalone item. It can be read and shared as if it were a
regular blog post. Even its format and overall presentation is that of a
typical article on this website (protesilaos.com).</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>

<h2>What is sovereignty</h2>

<p>Sovereignty is one of those concepts that enters the public mind never
to leave it again. It is as foundational as the very distinction between
the private and the public good, the institution of property rights, the
division of the state’s functions, the binding nature of statutes. In
the modern era, sovereignty underpins every instance of international
relations. It also underlies any discussion about legitimacy and the
rule of law. Contemporary polities are defined by this very
concept. They are based on sovereignty. Their state’s powers are
permeated by it. Their political processes are meant to harness and to
exercise it.</p>

<p>In short, sovereignty matters. It has a profound effect on quotidian
life. It lies at the heart of normative discussions about the
appropriate distribution of authority within and between states. Its
significance is paramount. There is, however, a point of contention: its
ambiguity.</p>

<p>As with every major item of political thought, the concept of
“sovereignty” occupies a space between clarity and obscurity. It is an
age old idea that has guided many a generation of statesperson into
forming the specifics of their polity. Its presence in legal-political
tradition is central. Primary law, such as national constitutions or the
treaties establishing the European Union, draws its legitimacy—its
authority qua primary law—by being a codified expression of sovereignty.</p>

<p>Only a political whole exercising effective sovereign control may
proceed to establish the particularities of its legal order. Law is, in
this specific regard, a predicate of sovereignty. Yet it takes a certain
legal order to render a polity sovereign. That very circularity is the
source of contention: the presumption of sovereignty as a
quasi-transcendent presence that ‘exists’, can always be talked about,
named and described, but never fully revealed as to what kind of being
it may be.</p>

<h3>Sovereignty is not a natural given</h3>

<p>Is sovereignty a physical force like, say, gravity? It should then be
referred to in precise terms. Measured. Quantified. Be given a clear
definition that would not offer plausibility to multiple
interpretations. At least that should be the direction. The concept
could not afford to remain decisively ambiguous yet still be the
cornerstone of political thinking.</p>

<p>Sovereignty cannot be considered in that light though. It is sometimes
treated as if it were a natural force: <em>antecedent</em> to political
organisation. As if no human intervention or interpretation anyhow
contributed to its qualities. Yet this is a mere impression of an
outright political phenomenon: the belief that products of convention
are, in fact, external to it. Their substance or value is perceived as
exogenous. A natural given.</p>

<p>On the face of it, this view could hold merit. Sovereignty is a constant
of the world and so all political thinking can be a function of
it. Where such reification begins to reveal its shortcomings is in the
particulars. How these affect the very presumed constancy of said
‘constant’. What transpires for a people once considered part of a
greater sovereign whole to qualify as sovereign in its own right? And
what may the ‘atom’ of sovereignty be, the point that cannot be divided
any further? Is sovereignty fastened upon any one construct or
abstraction thereof? Can new forms of polity become sovereign while old
ones fade into oblivion?</p>

<h3>Sovereignty as a nominal presence</h3>

<p>The more we liken sovereignty to a natural quantity, the greater our
confusion will be. It can be a helpful metaphor to simplify things and
get the point across. With “metaphor” being the operative term. Instead
it is preferable to establish a simple yet crucial distinction between
(i) phenomena whose value/substance is dependent on human experience and
(ii) those that can occur regardless of it. Gravity would exist even if
outlawed. Private property would not. What is contingent on human has a
metaphysically <em>nominal</em> value or substance. The rest are <em>natural</em>.</p>

<p>Nominal does not mean arbitrary. It is not a product of whimsy that can
be revised without much effort, say, by an eager government. Nominal is
that which is arrived at through a series of exchanges between persons
within their historical-cultural milieu. Generation after generation of
political thinking and practice informs this intersubjective
exchange. Nominality is evolutionary and organic, though decisively
human in origin. Its main difference to the natural world is found in
its potentiality. In principle, it <em>could</em> be revaluated in an instance
if everyone involved were to somehow agree to the new norm and passively
enforce it through their daily social conduct.</p>

<p>Consider this overly simplified case. The role model of ancient Sparta
was the frugal warrior. The guiding figure of Silicon Valley is the
entrepreneurial inventor. In <em>functional</em> terms, they are the same. Both
act as a point of reference for the highest <em>expected</em> achievement
within their social context. In <em>substantive</em> terms they stand
apart. That is to be attributed to the differences between the
contributing factors to the processes of attaching value to objects of
thought. Different cultures, experiences, roles and norms, expectations,
basic needs, available technology, and so on.</p>

<p>Sovereignty is nominal, a <em>nominal force</em> if you will. It is the supreme
authority within a polity. The entity considered to be sovereign
partakes of sovereignty. It has a <em>quality</em> of being sovereign. This
quality amounts to the ultimate right to exercise force—the legitimate
use of force—, whereby “force” is interpreted broadly to include, among
others, legal acts that specify the rights, obligations, and expected
behaviour of persons to whom it applies.</p>

<p>The sovereign is not predefined. It can be an individual, as in old
monarchies. It may be an impersonal agency, such as a nation. Some of
the effects of globalisation indicate that the sovereign may even be a
level of political organisation that emerges between nation
states. Whatever the specifics, we are dealing with nominal magnitudes
whose substantive particularities can be envisaged in line with—or in
juxtaposition to—tradition (effectively to the previous value attached
to them).</p>

<h3>The study of sovereignty</h3>

<p>To recapitulate on this overview, sovereignty is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intelligible.</strong> An object of thought—an abstraction—that exists in
the realm of political thinking as both a magnitude as well as the
quintessential quality of a legitimate governing entity.</li>
  <li><strong>Nominal.</strong> A product of human convention whose specifics are
formulated intersubjectively in a manner that is gradual and dependent
on the historical-cultural particulars.</li>
</ul>

<p>We study sovereignty to gain insight into the underlying themes of
political organisation. Modern politics is inconceivable in the absence
of this fundamental concept. The inquiry also has implications on
normative propositions. Discourses of agency and legitimacy are guided
by their conception of sovereignty. Who or what is the appropriate actor
of political initiative? Where is the locus of authority? Which are the
factors that render it acceptable as supreme? Is sovereignty absolute or
context-dependent? And what are the ramifications on the polity as such
and in its association with other states? Are nations necessarily
sovereign or is the exercise of supreme authority a prerequisite to a
nation qua nation state? Are sovereignty and nationality connatural? Can
there be a sovereign without a nation? And what could that be?</p>

<p>These and related questions probe into a number of areas of interest
that are all connected by their status as foundational or primary in the
context of political organisation. The study is largely theoretical due
to the subject of inquiry. These are abstract themes. They may be
political but have no direct comparison to day-to-day phenomena such as
party politics, electoral campaigns, public opinion polls, and the like.</p>

<p>It may seem counter-intuitive to talk about political issues in a manner
that is detached from daily experience. Politics is, after all,
thoroughly practical. About managing everyday issues and planning ahead
for the future. Yet politics is not a value-free exercise in management,
be it of people, resources, or whatnot. The political process,
intersubjectively emergent as it is, is formulated in accordance with a
set of accepted truths about a range of issues. Sovereignty is but one
of them. Others would include individuality, the family unit, social
status, gender roles, institutional function, etc. with whatever values
attached to them. These may not be the direct or main subject of
politics, though they most certainly inform, permeate, and penetrate all
sorts of discourses about political organisation.</p>

<p>Sovereignty is special in one important way. It is not <em>necessarily</em>
about the nominal qualities bestowed on the person or group thereof, as
are the notions of individuality, family, class. It is more about the
overarching design of the polity. Standing alongside it are such perhaps
consubstantial magnitudes as power, legitimacy, legality. That renders
it less immediate to the subjective experience. Its abstract nature does
not, nonetheless, make it remotely relevant or secondary to more
pressing issues of the practical sort. All it does is call for the
appropriate method of analysis. To understand it for what it actually
is. To identify its place in the totality of political thought and its
function in political practice in general.</p>

<h3>Remaining dubitative and inquisitive</h3>

<p>The title of this article—<em>What is sovereignty</em>—implies certainty. That
we know exactly what sovereignty is and that a definition will
suffice. The truth is that we are in the dark and are trying to
understand the topic based on what is available to our faculties of
thought and experience. We tackle one issue at a time in an attempt to
arrive at meaningful conclusions. The objective is to form an
understanding of the greater whole based on observations of the
specifics. What we may get might still not be definitive. The study is
likely to be open ended; the terminus we set standing as nothing but
arbitrary.</p>

<p>Even so, there is truth to be had in what effectively is
<em>interpretation</em>. Absolute certainty is not a prerequisite to
action. Just like perfect knowledge is not presupposed in any instance
of scientific inquiry. Politics both in its theoretical and practical
dimensions occurs in a realm of relative uncertainty and ignorance. And
there is a degree of inventiveness in all of it. We figure things out as
we go. The study of sovereignty can be no different.</p>

<h2>On self-determination</h2>

<p>Self-determination is the capacity of a polity to define the parameters
and qualitative aspects of its quotidian life. Rules of custom,
statutes, the specifics of institutional arrangements, social
stratification, the procedures that contribute to aspects of political
organisation, and the like. These are designed to be consistent with the
polity’s prevailing ideas and perspectives on political life. What may
hold true in one state, may not apply to another. What may be the case
in a state at a point in time, might not have been so during a different
epoch.</p>

<p>This plurality, this plasticity, is the outcome of an ever present
process of self-determination. The operative term is “process”. This is
not a single phenomenon. A discrete moment in the time continuum that
can be singled out. Some events may be more important than others in
terms of their impact on political life, but the general trend is for
incremental changes to an ever-evolving corpus of values, practices,
standards, beliefs.</p>

<p>Politics is in a state of flux. New issues come up that require
addressing. Legislation needs to be introduced to tackle previously
unforeseen circumstances. Social roles, the organisation of labour,
methods for distributing the goods of the polity, are all subject to
[gradual] revaluation. They can be envisaged and upheld as different.</p>

<h3>Holistic view of the political whole</h3>

<p>Politics as such is an emergent reality. It is organic. A system of
interpersonal relations engendering phenomena that can only exist at the
higher scope of interaction rather than the ‘foundational’ level of the
individual human. Just as there can be no <em>absolutely</em> private ethics or
language (decontextualised from any external reference, stimulus, point
of interaction, etc.), there exist states of affairs that may only be
understood as outright political; germane to the system—the organic
whole—itself.</p>

<p>The ‘self’ that gets to be determined is, therefore, neither an
individual nor, most importantly, a collection of individuals <em>conceived
as a group</em>. The political self is the collection of individuals <em>in
addition</em> to their prevailing culture. What is subject to determination
through the political process is not the material constitution of the
persons involved, but rather the more abstract yet very much immanent
cobweb of <em>given truths</em> that holds them together as a group.</p>

<h3>The function of simplification</h3>

<p>It is indeed the case that aggregates such as “the society” or “the
state” do not have human faculties of intellect, experience,
emotion. They do not act or think in the way you and I do. Aggregates
are abstractions, mental constructs used to help us gain a better grasp
on reality and to facilitate our communication.</p>

<p>Reduction is necessary to get the point across. We use it for virtually
everything. Imagine substituting <em>“the government decided”</em> with <em>“the
collection of individuals elected on a fixed term basis through a formal
process as representatives of a larger group of people legally defined
as citizens, for the sake of pursuing certain ends, and operating within
a given framework of laws whose basis is another legal document known as
the “constitution”, decided…“</em>. Communication would quickly become
unwieldy, impractical.</p>

<p>The same kind of necessary simplification applies to the elements of
social aggregates, most notably “the individual” or “the
corporation”. The notion of the decontextualised natural/legal person,
the agent who behaves in accordance with their own will as if no
physical or cultural factor ever determines them, is only useful in
reducing an otherwise complex reality to its basics. It has no
ontological basis: the absolute individual is, strictly speaking, a
chimera.</p>

<h3>The sources of causation on the person</h3>

<p>From a biological perspective, human is matter. An animal that exhibits
many commonalities with other beings, especially mammals and
primates. Our genes determine what we as a species can do. The
determinism or, rather, <em>the probabilism</em> that holds true for all nature
applies to us as well. Human is part of nature, not a distinct category.</p>

<p>This is the natural aspect of causality. Some event in the physical
order triggers a process which ultimately manifests through, inter alia,
chemical reactions in the brain and/or body as thought, emotion, action.</p>

<p>But human is not <em>just</em> matter. It is a formation of natural systems of
interrelations, each at its own level of abstraction and complexity,
from the atoms to the organs to the specimen “human”, which itself
partakes in—and is affected by—an even broader context: their social
environment.</p>

<p>The relations between humans and the products thereof have a basis in
the natural order, yet they are not matter per se. Consider language,
the very text written here. There are faculties that enable humans to
speak, write, think, and to communicate meanings to their fellows. That
is the natural foundation. The nominality of it is found in the content
of language. The meanings, the syntax, the grammar germane to a given
code of communication effectively are products of convention rather than
natural necessity. They <em>could have been</em> conceived, understood,
structured in a different manner.<sup id="fnref:LanguageArbitrariness" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:LanguageArbitrariness" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This ‘convention’ was not agreed upon at any given moment in any one
place. It has developed through a continuous process of interaction
between humans. The phenomenon of language is intersubjective
throughout. Not only due to language being a historical-cultural
invention, but also in the very manifestation of language as an
instrument necessary for advanced communication between humans. There
can be no language in a decontextualised, an absolute individual. The
very notion of communicating ideas to others would be absurd.</p>

<h3>The nominal environment</h3>

<p>The same line of thinking holds for other social phenomena such as
morality, the institution of property rights, political hierarchies, and
the like. Even if they have a source in nature, their content or value
is nominal. To this end, by virtue of a holistic approach on human
presence, we may consider the nominal environment as a domain that
contributes to the determination of the individual, just as the natural
order exerts its force on human’s material composition.</p>

<p>The nominal environment, the set of intersubjective factors and
parameters, is external to the individual. The person is immersed in a
social milieu that already is in the process of determining itself. They
are born into a certain culture, endowed with whatever their social
surroundings provide for. The moral code, the concepts embedded in
language, gender roles, the opportunities for economic, recreational, or
intellectual initiative and expression; the “what is” of the person is
to a large extent moulded by their nominal environment. The person—the
<em>contextualised</em> individual—gets to operate within a realm of
possibility delineated by emergent realities of an intersubjective sort
that necessarily remain outside their immediate reach.</p>

<p>This is not to suggest that individuality is irrelevant or a mere
illusion. Given the probabilism of the world, what we traditionally
understand as the essence of the individual—free will—must have certain
probabilities attached to it for its expression. There is no
predetermined linearity to the chain of causation. Individuality has
scope for being made manifest, with the proviso that it is not absolute,
i.e. immune to influences from the natural and nominal surroundings.</p>

<p>By labelling this type of determinism “nominal” we are merely drawing a
distinction from the natural sort. What we are not trying to do is
discount its immediacy and actual impact. Social realities may be the
product of self-determination and, therefore, potentially subject to
change. But for as long as they are what they are, their effects on
<em>human experience</em> are as real as they get.</p>

<h3>Methodology matters</h3>

<p>We have dedicated an entire chapter of this book to clarify a rather
simple, seemingly obvious, point: the political whole is not a
person. When we suggest that “the polity” determines itself we are not
claiming that some exalted being consciously takes a certain course of
action independent of the will of the individuals. What we are arguing
for instead is that the process of self-determination manifests
incrementally as the cumulative effect of all social experiences. The
emergent phenomena thereof cannot be discerned at the level of the
individual. A broader perspective, a holistic analysis, is required.</p>

<p>So if the point is simple, why not get done with it in a paragraph or
two? Because simplicity is often appreciated only after its actual
complexity is put in a certain order. Obvious is that which has been
analysed. Many dubious claims in politics derive from misunderstandings
that could have been avoided if some more thought was put on the
perspective, the <em>scope of application</em> of the proposed truth.</p>

<p>Consider, for instance, the extremes of individualism and
collectivism. Both share a common fallacy: the decontextualisation of
their subject of inquiry. For the individualist of the extreme sort
there is no such thing as a ‘nominal’ source of determination, maybe not
even a natural one. Human is <em>a priori</em> free to do as they please, reap
the rewards of their decisions and suffer the consequences (think how
that value system impacts social welfare, the prison system, and the
like). For the collectivist all that matters is the collective as such,
the society, the nation, the state, whatever it is they see as the
higher-order being. No such things as individual freedoms and civil
liberties can be allowed to exist, especially if they do not serve the
‘interests’ of the collective itself.</p>

<p>The holistic approach we have adopted here aims to put the concept of
“self-determination” in its proper context. Polities are in a process of
evolution. What applies to the polity has powerful effects on the
individuals immersed in it. But the polity is not a distinct entity with
no link whatsoever to the underlying relations of the persons
involved. What people in their daily life choose to do also has an
impact on the qualities of their political whole. Hence the claim that
politics is organic. “Organic” does not mean biological. It denotes a
system of interdependent variables, ordered at different levels of
abstraction, governed by general rules as well as particular ones that
only hold true for each level, where cause and effect are not
necessarily linear and may therefore contribute to a range of
mutually-exclusive probable outcomes.</p>

<p>This enriched view can help us cast the notion of “sovereignty” in a
different light. As something that is adaptable. That can change with
the times. A concept whose use in political organisation is dependent on
the specifics. Self-determination may attain a new character. It once
was treated as national self-determination. Though it might also be
international self-determination. This self is not a biological
given. It is a product of convention and practical necessity. Much like
its consubstantial magnitude: sovereignty.</p>

<h2>Scopes of sovereignty</h2>

<p>Nations choose to distribute authority within their jurisdiction in
accordance with their historical-cultural experiences. In its simplest
form, this is a unilateral practice. It only involves the given
people. In the modern era states seldom are isolated. The margins for
unilateral action are narrower than what they were once <em>perceived</em> to
be. In this age, where information technology, global finance and trade,
the ever growing significance of cyber, contribute to heightened global
awareness and inter-connectedness, the default venue of
self-determination is through multilateral relations.</p>

<p>The sovereignty of a nation is as much a function of its own collective
will as well as the product of the conditions or parameters of its
association with other states. To speak of sovereignty as a purely
national experience is to disregard the actuality of the present. States
cannot choose to remain in a capsule, immune to the direct or indirect
influences of their peers. Even the most isolationist of policies cannot
mitigate the spill-over effects of the actions of other states, such as
in the case of global warming, the condition of the financial markets,
the integrity of the global cyber architecture, and so on.</p>

<p>Sovereignty is neither monolithic nor absolute. It may trace its source
to the nation state, but is not limited to it. Nor is its expression
linear, starting from the bottom (of the nation) and ending in the top
(the international order). Sovereignty is moulded continuously both from
the top and the bottom. The <em>effective</em> supreme authority of a state at
a given point in time—its actual capacity to be self-determined—is a
reflection of the prevailing conditions at home and internationally. It
is a ‘negotiated result’, as it were, between general norms of politics
and law, as well as endogenous and exogenous factors that are
context-dependent and, thus, subject to differentiation.</p>

<p>Couched in those terms, it is best to consider the distribution of
authority in conjunction with the domain where self-determination
<em>between</em> states is made manifest.</p>

<h3>The rise of the supranational level</h3>

<p>As relations between states attain a legally binding character, so must
supreme authority for the items considered be transferred to the
supranational level. The idea that a nation can participate in the
world, conduct international trade, forge alliances, attend global fora
and the like, while also retaining its capacity for unilateral action,
is but an illusion. A misunderstanding of what “participation” in the
global order entails. Being in the world means giving up a portion of
the power to act unilaterally. This is either a conscious decision, such
as actively pursuing membership in an international organisation, or an
unwanted side effect, the outcome of the externalities engendered by
other actors in the globe.</p>

<p>International relations as such present us with a paradox. They posit
sovereignty as national. Self-determination as a domestic affair. Yet in
substantive terms, the policies derived therefrom are, at least in part,
diminishing the nations’ margin for unilateral action. They effectively
create the framework within which certain forms and modes of
self-determination are permissible. Simultaneously they ensure that the
parameters, the ‘rules of the game’ so to speak, cannot be rigged by any
one party. The framework would otherwise become obsolete.</p>

<p>Politics between states reveal how the narrow understanding of
sovereignty as ‘national’ is a largely incomplete notion in an
analytical sense. It (i) decontextualises the nation state, (ii)
conflates its headline right to exercise supreme authority with its
effective control over the full array of the means of governance, and
(iii) fails to account for the ‘parameter-setting’ of multilateral or
global affairs and, more specifically, how these have a profound effect
on domestic ‘agenda-setting’.</p>

<p>International relations are not the outward expression of national
sovereignty. They represent another level of political organisation at
which the exercise of supreme authority is made possible. This venue is
supranational. Above the nation state, though practically emergent from
the association of such states. Sovereignty thus represents a
stack. Layer upon layer of political processes which contribute to the
greater whole. Causation is circular. Local affairs are influenced or
framed by phenomena at higher levels—nation-wide issues, global events—,
while the higher levels can trace their origin to workings at the lower
end of the ‘stack’.</p>

<p>In this regard, there is nothing untoward with the view of sovereignty
as national. What is at stake here is the organon. The analytical
instrument that informs certain conclusions. National sovereignty is but
part of a whole. It is best viewed—and properly appreciated—in context
of its internal dynamics as well as the supranational realities.</p>

<h3>The three-fold expression of multilateralism</h3>

<p>Political phenomena can be understood as setting the items on the agenda
or framing the discussion thereof. The former is a more intrusive or
immediate type of influence. It goes into the specifics. How governance
is to be conducted. What it may encompass. The latter is rather
generic. It leaves a broader scope of interpretation or adaptation. It
sets the outer limits to political initiative. That which sets the
agenda has a more direct or evident effect on the political
process. Whereas that which operates parametrically tends to be treated
as a constant.</p>

<p>We may qualify international relations in accordance with their intended
impact on political processes at the national level. At its broadest,
the classification is three-fold:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Global principles.</strong> International covenants whose role is to set
standards on various items with universal presence. Human rights are
the prime example, though there are all sorts of more technical
issues such as aviation standards and the Law of the Sea.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose-specific agreements.</strong> Inter-state treaties with a
specialised focus where, apart from their normal high-level
diplomacy, the arbiter of legality for the items concerned is likely
to be a special tribunal or court system envisaged in the agreement
as independent from any of the national jurisdictions, or where the
domestic judiciary must adjudicate in accordance with the provisions
of said agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>Transnational state building.</strong> Pacts between states that regulate
an expanded range of policies, establish a fully fledged layer of
political processes above the nation state, and redistribute the
power to make and enforce decisions accordingly. The European Union,
the integration process in particular, is a case in point.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above can be initially understood as a spectrum with the first being
closer to the ‘parameter-setting’ end while the third would stand at the
other extreme of ‘agenda-setting’. That metaphor, however, is but a
guide to a much more nuanced study. The parameter-agenda binary is
purely theoretical. In practice the two are intertwined. A set of global
principles, such as those emanating from the Law of the Sea, does define
the outer limits of national action, <em>while simultaneously</em> influencing
the relevant items on the agenda. Drawing the Exclusive Economic Zone,
fostering the necessary diplomatic relations with neighbouring
countries, and the like, are all part of the political process, with the
actors involved having their own views on the matter.</p>

<p>The binary is helpful in conjunction with the understanding of
sovereignty as a multi-layered whole, a ‘stack’. We can identify the
factors that operate at the various levels of abstraction, both with
respect to their content and the source of their origin. By judging a
phenomenon based on its impact, we can determine whether it relates to
either end of the spectrum. We may, thus, appreciate the extent to which
a certain relationship between states diffuses or enhances national
sovereignties.</p>

<h3>Global principles</h3>

<p>It can be argued that global principles have no impact on national
sovereignty whatsoever. In contrast, they set general guidelines that
help establish a level playing field for all states in the world. They
ground a generally-accepted corpus of legality essential to the mutual
recognition of all states as sovereign. They set the parameters of
international politics, what is permissible and accepted in the broadest
sense, without restricting the capacity for self-determination in any
major way.</p>

<p>Though indeed parametrical in that regard, it is in the nature of any
codified command—a piece of law—to enable certain states of affairs
while forbidding others. Human rights, for instance, essentially define
a series of mutually exclusive worlds within the realm of
possibility. By providing for, say, the freedom of expression, they
restrict the prerogative of a government to restrict said freedom. These
two possible outcomes cannot exist simultaneously, while the latter has
no normative foundation at all under the scope of human rights.</p>

<p>Upon closer inspection we realise that global principles have major
implications on the agenda. A government cannot justify violations of a
global principle on the basis of its sovereign authority. There is no
normatively acceptable capacity for self-determination when that
contradicts a universal value. Sanctions from other states or the
international community as such may ensue. The agenda must therefore be
formulated in compliance with the principles. From the perspective of
the national government, especially the one that interprets its national
sovereignty as absolute, a global principle can be a hindrance to the
implementation of its various programmes.</p>

<h3>Purpose-specific agreements</h3>

<p>Treaties that only address an exhaustive list of issues necessarily have
limited implications on the overall capacity of the nation states
involved to exercise their supreme authority. This comes down to a
couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Application.</strong> The nation states give up some of their power only on
the policies envisaged in the agreement or the elements thereof. Other
than that their legal standing to exercise legitimate force remains in
tact.</li>
  <li><strong>Enforcement.</strong> The institution that may resolve tensions between the
contracting parties likely is a court of law. There is no higher level
government, no parliament, army, police, etc. In practice this means
that the enforcement of the treaty’s letter or spirit is typically
cumbersome and subject to all sorts of technical disputes.</li>
</ul>

<p>When states enter into a purpose-specific agreement, say, a trade deal
they choose to forgo their respective right of imposing trade
restrictions on each other and confer the power to arbitrate on that
matter to a supranational tribunal or source of legality. Whether the
parties to the agreement formally recognise it or not, they are
effectively giving up a portion of their supreme authority by
transferring a degree of sovereignty to the emergent supranational
stratum.</p>

<p>There is, nonetheless, an important distinction between agreements for
the mutual diminution of conflicting sovereignties, such as in a trade
deal, and agreements for the mutual enhancement of the capacity to
exercise supreme authority. Some deals place restrictions on
governments. Others offer them more power to implement their agenda. An
example of the latter could be a pact to share tax-related
information. Corporations that operate across the boundaries of the
parties to that agreement would thus find it more difficult to engineer
some tax avoidance scheme. Other examples would be agreements for police
cooperation, anti-terrorism, and the like. The governments involved
stand to <em>increase</em> their effective sovereignty from international
relations of that sort.</p>

<p>We may therefore posit that the impact of international relations on the
actual distribution of power is contingent on the particulars. More
specifically how these affect the exercise of <em>effective</em> supreme
authority, even in cases where the nation states involved opt to confer
a portion of their <em>headline</em> sovereignty to the supranational level. On
paper states delegate power to the higher level, in practice they gain a
better grasp on the means of governance.</p>

<h3>Supranational state building</h3>

<p>With that insight in mind, we can proceed to further enrich the concept
of sovereignty. Purpose-specific agreements can either be merged into a
comprehensive legal corpus or form a de facto nexus of compatible nodes
of supranational self-determination.</p>

<p>Consider this. A group of states opts to forge an agreement on trade. It
then formulates a similar deal for handling energy resources. Another
agreement on mutual defence is introduced. Police cooperation
follows. As do cyber-related functions. The free movement of persons,
the need for some common standards on how to approach issues of a shared
interest, etc. also get to be included.</p>

<p>The result or cumulative effect is the substantiation of an outright
supranational layer of political processes, at least in functional
terms. The venue for the exercise of supreme authority is broader than
the nation. It is not an aggregate though: a sum of national
sovereignties. It rather is an emergent phenomenon, an addition,
extension—and oftentimes facilitator—of nation state politics. An
altogether different scope of sovereignty.</p>

<p>This integration of areas of policy is a general description of
international relations between closely-related states. Of what actually
happens when nation states engage in international cooperation over an
expanded array of policies. The scenario also is a broad generalisation
of the European integration process and of how the European Union has
become a complex federal system comprising a number of nation
states.<sup id="fnref:EUGuide" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:EUGuide" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>What we are describing here is the actuality of things. They may not be
considered such in formal terms. And that would be so due to an
incorrect method of analysis. Indeed if we study a nation’s relations
with its peers we will identify a set of purpose-specific deals together
with some agreements of the global principles sort. Seeing these in
isolation is erroneous. They have to be examined holistically as a
nexus, provided they are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>For example: let us assume that the negotiated trade agreement between
the United States and the European Union (the “TTIP”) gets to pass. In
its own accord it is a purpose-specific deal, its comprehensiveness
notwithstanding. But the fact would still be that the US-EU relations
extend to other ares of policy, such as the exchange of Passenger Name
Records, NATO, etc.</p>

<p>The analytical problem that arises with this line of reasoning is with
relation to a secondary qualification. Though we may still be confronted
with an effective state-building process, gradual as it undoubtedly is,
we are missing one important element: democracy, the normative
underpinnings of the political processes involved. The main reason we
can distinguish ever closer cooperation between states such as the US-EU
type from those germane to the European Union is that the former is
purely technocratic whereas the latter are also made manifest in a
milieu of substantive constitutional norms and democratic modes of
decision making.</p>

<h3>The perception of control</h3>

<p>Normativity has an intrinsic value. It can just as well be interpreted
in practical terms. Where democratic processes exist, citizens have a
stronger sense of control over the overall direction of the
polity. Whereas technocratic methods tend to alienate people, making
them think that they are indeed giving up their sovereignty.</p>

<p>It perhaps is this very fact that reinforces the feeling that the proper
scope of sovereignty is the one of the nation state. Democracy has
traditionally been limited to the national lifeworld. International
affairs are nonetheless evolving with the times. A hundred years ago it
was much more difficult to conduct trade in the same way as today. The
global financial world was not interconnected. International
institutions were either non-existent or, where present, practically
irrelevant. Information technology was far inferior to the one now
available. In short, globalisation forces us to shift our perspective.</p>

<p>All sorts of contemporary challenges simply did not exist a century
ago. New tools are needed to tackle them. At the core of this emerging
‘new politics’ is an enriched understanding of sovereignty. One that is
not necessarily fastened upon the national construct. A sovereignty that
is allowed to flourish at the level of inter-state cooperation most
pertinent to the issue at hand. And, most importantly, one that can be
recognised as independent or transcendent of the national context. That
is a revaluated normative foundation. It allows for democracy at every
scope of self-determination from the sub-national all the way to the
supranational, with whatever permutations or combinations in between.</p>

<h2>Factors of effective sovereignty</h2>

<p>There is a distinction to be made between <em>headline</em> and <em>effective</em>
sovereignty. The former concerns the formal aspect. The surface
level. It is limited to the historically legal-political conception of
sovereignty as the normative foundation of an internationally recognised
and self-determined nation state. Whereas the latter is substantive. It
treats sovereignty as supreme authority within a political whole. This
amounts to the control over the means of governance, broadly
understood. The two can be decoupled. There can be instances where on
paper a state is considered sovereign, when in actuality it has little
to no margin for its self-determination. And vice-versa.</p>

<p>Headline sovereignty is the kind one finds at the formal level of
international relations, such as the United Nations. The three main
facets of such sovereign authority are enshrined in Article 2 of the UN
Charter. More specifically in provisions 1 and 4 (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Article 2.1. The Organization is based on the principle of the
<strong>sovereign equality</strong> of all its Members.</p>

  <p>Article 2.4. All Members shall refrain in their international
relations from the threat or use of force against the <strong>territorial
integrity</strong> or <strong>political independence</strong> of any state, or in any
other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the UN’s references to sovereignty we may infer the following set
of principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Equality.</strong> All nation states that are members of the UN are
considered equal in terms of their sovereignty. In other words, the
sovereignty of one does not take precedence or is superior to that of
another (Article 2.1).</li>
  <li><strong>Independence.</strong> All sovereign nation states are independent from
interventions from other states, including the use of threats or
outright force. Independence is the other side of the principle of
equality, while it also means that all sovereign states are considered
political wholes, as being discrete, distinguishable from each other
(Article 2.4).</li>
  <li><strong>Territoriality.</strong> Sovereign authority is confined to a physical
space, the area within which a nation state’s independence may be
exercised. Territoriality is, in this regard, the physical embodiment
of the constitutional order and, consequently, partakes of the same
principle of indivisibility and integrity. Territoriality cannot be
divided, with a portion of it no longer qualifying as part of the
independent and equally sovereign nation state.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the above principles, we may also include the following implicit
ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Continuity.</strong> Every state continues to exist as a state even if its
people may change or its legal order undergoes a period of crisis.</li>
  <li><strong>Uniformity.</strong> The state is understood as the primary actor of
diplomatic affairs in the international order and is treated as a
single personality.</li>
  <li><strong>Nationhood.</strong> The identification of the state with a given
culturally-defined people.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two lists form a solid understanding of sovereignty, especially in
its emanation as national sovereignty. Many instances of international
politics can be analysed and indeed comprehended in those terms. Where
the lists fall short is with regard to their application on atypical
(rather ‘atypical’) cases. Instances of civil war, armed conflicts,
outright invasion of one state or group thereof into another’s
space. These cannot conform with notions of equality between states,
independence from external influences, territorial integrity, whatever
the justification and its reasonableness.</p>

<p>But it is not just the implosion of a certain normality or equilibrium
that defies the aforementioned. Transnational state-building such as in
the case of the European integration process, even though seldom
referred to as such, has similar implications. Independence becomes
interdependence. Territoriality no longer is uniform in terms of
jurisdiction, for the policies implemented therein may have been
delegated to non-national entities or political processes at the
supranational level. Equality is contextualised in light of
demographics, economic policy, and the like, so that it may imply
equality of citizens though not necessarily of states in terms of their
actual impact or involvement.</p>

<h3>Effective sovereignty is a matter of analytics</h3>

<p>There is value to be had in an analysis of such phenomena through the
prism of headline sovereignty. Though its conclusions would be
incomplete if taken in isolation. The traditional view of sovereignty
can thus lead to erroneous conclusions.</p>

<p>Here we draw a distinction between what holds true in formal terms and
what does in effect. All states are perceived as sovereign. That is the
law. Yet their capacity to realise such principle is contingent on the
prevailing conditions of the international order as well as qualitative
aspects of quotidian life.</p>

<p>As concerns the latter, we need to examine in a different light a set of
factors that underpin the exercise of governance. Effective sovereignty
is about the things that enable the presence of a supreme authority. In
broad terms these include the following, which we will proceed to
discuss in the subsequent sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>territoriality</li>
  <li>rule of law</li>
  <li>economic welfare</li>
  <li>social cohesion</li>
  <li>self-conscious demos</li>
</ul>

<h3>Territoriality</h3>

<p>States are sovereign within a given territory. Though the term
“territory” may etymologically refer to a land mass, we are here using
it to denote areas over which the polity can exert rightful control. Sea
and air are included in this definition, as well as the more abstract
notion of cyber.</p>

<p>Territoriality is the space within which the law of the polity reigns
supreme. No person, be it legal or natural, nor group thereof, can
exercise greater authority than the state institution competent over
that defined area. The ‘polity’ is not necessarily the nation state. It
is neither fixed nor monolithic. In addition to the national
institutional order, it can be the supranational level competent over
the policy at hand. For example, supreme authority over monetary affairs
in the euro area is exercised by the European Central Bank. No single
nation state that is part of the eurozone (the defined area) can
override that authority even within its own borders (where it is thought
to have headline sovereignty).</p>

<p>This is the <em>vertical</em> dimension of territoriality. It concerns the
distribution of competences within its boundaries. Powers that apply to
a given territory may be held by multiple agents of political
initiative. Sub-national government, national administration,
supranational institutions that are possibly linked to more than one
international organisation or platform. Verticality may thus be
heterogeneous, of multiple kinds.</p>

<p>The <em>horizontal</em> dimension is intimately linked to citizenship or rather
to the fact that persons within the territory are equally subject to the
law of the polity. This is distinct from the normative claims on the
rights of human and citizen. It is not substantive, as it merely
describes the relationship between persons as well as their position
vis-à-vis the state.</p>

<p>In a more quotidian sense, territoriality is the space within which all
formal political processes take place. Relations between persons are
regulated, framed, or otherwise determined by the prevailing conditions
within the polity. These range from rules of custom to statutes, from
social stratification to moral outlook, from underlying values to
current behavioural or intellectual trends.</p>

<p>Territoriality must therefore not be limited to the drawing of borders
on a map. That is but a formal starting point. Territoriality is, in
effect, the manifestation of statehood and constitutional identity. In
this respect, it is the single most important indicator of sovereignty,
insufficient as it may be when taken in its own capacity.</p>

<h3>Rule of law</h3>

<p>A polity can practically be understood as a network of laws. Laws are
codified commands that perform a number of functions to the effect that
they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>draw the limits of legality within the boundaries of territoriality
(territory itself being defined by laws, including of the
international community at large);</li>
  <li>institute authorities, their scope and ends;</li>
  <li>establish the qualities of institutions and interrelations thereof;</li>
  <li>provide for the regulation of daily activities;</li>
  <li>demarcate private and public spheres, by outlining what may be
considered a common good and what may remain under proprietary
control.</li>
</ul>

<p>This non-exhaustive list can be summarised as law being the underlying
enabling factor in every aspect of political life. By likening law to a
codified system we are not attempting to describe it as precise, devoid
of ambiguity, and thoroughly syntactical. Law typically is subject to
interpretation and remains somewhat generic in its description of
triggers for its activation. Hence the presence of institutions
specialising in its application and its context-dependent
interpretation.</p>

<p>Law is here treated as a system of code in an attempt to suggest that
its every item is contingent on the quality of the code base and
structure. If the system malfunctions, there must be some tension
between its various parts, something not behaving as expected. This is
what we actually mean by the “rule of law”: a legal system that operates
in accordance with its predefined functions. There is no substantive
aspect to it. That would require a further qualification, such as the
<em>democratic</em> rule of law.</p>

<p>The integrity of the legal order is a factor of sovereignty in that it
provides for at least two consubstantial political qualities that
facilitate the effective exercise of supreme authority. These are (i)
the indiscriminate nature of the law and (ii) its coherence and
consistency over specific cases and the passing of time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Indiscriminate.</strong> The capacity to treat similar cases <em>as similar</em>
and dissimilar ones <em>as dissimilar</em>. This guarantees the
predictability of interpersonal or social affairs, while it also
ensures that authorities operate within their remit.</li>
  <li><strong>Absolute.</strong> The preservation of the equality of opportunity or
outcomes, typically understood as the temporal coherence of the law’s
effect or else its consistent, non-arbitrary application. It underpins
the sense of trust in the state and its effectiveness, or more
specifically the belief in the near-sacrosanct status of the law,
practically understood as rules not being rigged.</li>
</ul>

<p>What the rule of law does is guarantee a modicum of social peace and
cohesion. It provides for consistency among political processes. It
predefines the margin of the authorities’ discretion and preempts abuses
of power. If the subjects of the law recognise that the horizontal
dimension of territoriality is respected, i.e. that all citizens are
equal <em>qua</em> citizens, then they will also accept that the vertical
dimension, that of the polity being able to rule, is worth keeping in
tact.</p>

<p>Where the legal system begins to lose its integrity there emerge all
sorts of problems and tensions. Social unrest, economic uncertainty,
worsening of the relations with other countries. This is not about the
substance of the law becoming less democratic per se. Deterioration of
this kind is not normative but functional. It refers to an unexpected,
unforeseen, or otherwise contentious drift towards a new
equilibrium. Such changes have far-reaching ramifications, not just in
legal terms, but in the very social-political order of the state: the
compact that once held everything in place, defining that normality.</p>

<p>The rule of law is a polity’s organic defence against endogenous
tendencies for the violent settlement of social affairs, i.e. rebellion,
revolution, terrorism, or civil war. Adding democracy to it only makes
it more robust due to (i) the intrinsic justice of human rights and
fundamental freedoms, (ii) the inherent value of pluralism and
participation in decision-making, and (iii) the compatibility with the
law of the international community which makes relations with other
countries more straightforward.</p>

<h3>Economic welfare and social cohesion</h3>

<p>Similar to the previous section, economic welfare and social cohesion
are critical for ensuring social peace, and hence for providing the
conditions for the unencumbered exercise of effective sovereignty.</p>

<p>Widespread economic well-being and social peace jointly are a factor of
sovereignty because they bestow on the subject a sense of duty towards
the commons. Civic obedience. This moral quality underpins one’s
disposition to e.g. recognise the institutions of the state as indeed
legitimised in what they do, to identify in statutes and courts a source
of legality, and so on.</p>

<p>In other words, it provides the subject with a justification to preserve
and iterate on the institutional order of their polity, rather than be
inimical to it to the point of seeking its total annihilation. And
therein lies the factor of sovereignty: in the recognition that a
perpetually formed-and-confirmed bond exists between the authorities and
the individuals that make up the political whole.</p>

<p>Economic exclusion, vast inequalities in the access to resources and the
actual opportunities available to the person, can undermine the polity’s
ethical role. The law will not be seen as delivering justice, but as
sustaining an undesirable state of affairs. Social exclusion and
marginalisation, based on economic, cultural, religious, racial or other
factors forces the excluded group to rely on its own mores. It is a
practical necessity since the polity does not provide for them. Parallel
societies may thus emerge, whose connection to the body politic is
tenuous at best, existing only in a formal sense.</p>

<p>A subject of persistent social-economic inequality, be it individual or
group, may harbour no sense of civic obedience, no respect toward the
state they live in. Phenomena such as that of homegrown terrorism might
as well be partially influenced by a feeling of revolt to what they
perceive as endemic injustice: unequal opportunities in the marketplace,
inadequate representation in political affairs, etc.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the sovereign, where such parallel societies
exist, all sorts of obstacles are placed in the efforts to optimally
organise social life. The capacity to tax those groups is hindered, as
are other functions of statehood, such as public education, provisions
for public health and safety, law and order, and so on.</p>

<h3>Self-conscious demos</h3>

<p>By default, the demos of the state is the legally recognised totality of
citizens. Citizenship is a legal condition. It is created as law and is
given selectively. It can be taken provided certain irregular
circumstances. Its substantive qualities, the rights conferred to the
individual and the obligations derived therefrom, are contingent on the
polity’s practical morality. What sort of fundamental rights it
protects, whether the rule of law is respected, and the like.</p>

<p>Yet the demos cannot be instituted as such by virtue of a mere
edict. The citizens also need to harbour a basic feeling of belonging to
their citizenry. Law as such cannot foster that. It is the participation
of the individual in the commons that brings them into the fold. The
more inclusive the public space, the higher the consciousness of the
demos in its presence as an organic whole.</p>

<p>The reason this is considered a factor of sovereignty can be understood
in terms of social cohesion, as mentioned above, but also as a mutually
invigorating feedback between the state and the subjects of its
laws. Take the European Union as a case in point. There exists a legal
instrument which bestows on any EU national the status of European
citizen. The legal aspect is more or less covered. What is missing is
the sense of participation in the “Europeanness” of said citizenship.</p>

<p>When the people in Greece react to the austerity measures of the
‘troika’, they do not object to ‘their’ policy-makers, but to their
country’s international creditors. The sense of being Greek takes
precedence over that of being European. And that feeling extends to the
other electorates across Europe, for the troika was indeed designed as
an international grouping of creditors to reinforce the idea that the
Greek economic woes are indeed ‘Greek’, not European.</p>

<p>The point is not the politics of Europe’s single currency. It is that in
the absence of a self-conscious demos the executive—in our example the
EU—can find it extremely difficult to legitimise the segment of its
actions that aim to promote the general good. If the European Commission
were to somehow restructure the debts of the ‘European periphery’ in
search of pursuing the good of the EU as a whole, chances are that the
‘European core’ would have reacted in the most vociferous of fashions,
risking a fracture in the system.</p>

<p>Without sufficient space for legitimising state initiatives, effective
sovereignty is reduced. The scope of what can be done is in many ways
define by whether the demos thinks of its own as a whole, and whether it
is prepared to make sacrifices over the short term in order to further
reinforce its own cohesion qua demos.</p>

<h3>National sovereignty does not equal power</h3>

<p>The traditional view of sovereignty is that supreme authority rests
in—and emanates from—the nation. Only nation states can be
sovereign. Through this chapter we have tried to contest that view. To
argue that this is a formal convention, not a description of actual
phenomena.</p>

<p>The argument rests on the premise that there is a distinction to be made
between the surface aspects of sovereignty and the substantive qualities
thereof. We have labelled the former <em>headline sovereignty</em>. The latter
is <em>effective sovereignty</em>. The headline is indeed that: the impression
of a certain state of affairs. A judgement made <em>prima facie</em>. Whereas
the effective is decoupled from formalities. It is about the means of
governance, the factors of supreme authority within a political whole.</p>

<p>A polity that does not exercise control over the factors of effective
sovereignty is unable to be self-determined. Its determination proceeds
in accordance with the direction set by the forces that influence those
factors.</p>

<p>Global affairs are replete with cases where national sovereignty is but
an empty shell. It exists in name only. From failed states to
protectorates to de facto colonies of hegemonic powers and/or
multinational corporations, there is ample evidence to suggest that the
theoretical framework is too rigid. Perhaps out of sync with the times.</p>

<p>By distinguishing between form and substance we can develop a better
understanding of phenomena. A few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is a nation state truly sovereign when it cannot tax sufficiently a
multinational corporation? On paper it is. In practice any attempt to
raise taxes may lead to capital outflows.</li>
  <li>Is the European Union sovereign? In formal terms it is not. Only its
nations are. Its competences are transferred to it by the nations to
pursue certain functional ends. And yet, the EU does exercise
effective sovereignty over those policies where it is competent (as in
the case of the euro).</li>
  <li>Is Syria or Libya sovereign? They have national sovereignty. In
practice there is no national compact to speak of.</li>
</ul>

<p>The more subtle point is that statespersonship is not sufficed with
securing headline sovereignty. It is concerned with the factors of
effective sovereignty. How to control them and maximise their
potential. As for the overarching theme, it lies in the fine distinction
between the static entity that is the state and the adaptable one that
is the polity. The former is the body recognised as holding public
authority. The latter is the emergent province of effective sovereignty,
which may encompass multiple levels of ‘state’, including supranational
political processes or prevailing conditions. The two sometimes overlap,
depending on the area of policy and whether the nation state has control
over the full array of the means of governance. That is
case-dependent. The general truth is that they are distinguishable, much
like to magnitudes of headline and effective sovereignty.</p>

<h2>The market as a political agent</h2>

<p>This chapter starts with a seemingly problematic proposition: its very
title. The market, an inanimate system of economic relations, is claimed
to be a political actor, a subject of the political process. We tend to
think of [democratic] politics as the theatre of voters, their
representatives, media outlets, vested interests; the forum where the
plurality of society’s perspectives on life is expressed (more or
less). And in so doing, we may be assuming that the subject of politics
is necessarily a person or group thereof. What about systems <em>as such</em>?
Can the parameters that otherwise define a certain group <em>themselves</em>
partake in political life?</p>

<p>The train of thought leads us to a question about method. It is a matter
of defining the agent of politics. Agency or structure. This is the
binary we are dealing with. There are individuals that act. Their
actions are determined or otherwise framed by the <em>nominal
environment</em>. Action is a function of upbringing, collective
experiences, social status, education, what the law or custom promotes
and suppresses, what tradition sees as just and unjust, the sphere of
possibility revealed by effective technology, and the like. Whatever may
be considered external to the person, yet inherent in their
intersubjective lifeworld, has to qualify as structure. It is ‘there’
regardless of the individual’s will.</p>

<p>To this end, one would expect that the factors that frame or otherwise
condition a group of economics actors—what we sum up as “the market”—is
itself a facet of structure. It cannot be an agent by logical
necessity. But since the consideration revolves around method, we might
as well scrutinise the very dichotomy that seems to lead to this
contradiction. Agency and structure are meaningful categories when we
study <em>human action</em>. They collapse into themselves and create
methodological uncertainty when applied to a holistic analysis of the
polity, i.e. when we move away from human action per se.</p>

<p>To put it simply, if we focus on human relations, social class falls
under the classification of ‘structure’. It conditions the behaviour of
situational agents and patients. An individual is endowed with whatever
their place (or starting point) in society allows for. The exact same
state of affairs requires a different approach altogether when
considered under the scope of the polity as such, for social class has
implications on the distribution of power and influence. A class may
colonise the state to the point of exerting its control over the rest of
society. This does not happen at the level of the individual or group
thereof, but at the class as such. Political systems such as feudalism
provide an historical case in point. It is not the individual[s]—those
living—that enforce their dominion over the rest of society, but anyone
who may be part of the class, including the generations to be by virtue
of the institution of hereditary rule.</p>

<p>The distinction may seem pedantic. It certainly is. Reflections on
method are necessarily as much. Yet ‘pedantic’ does not mean
‘irrelevant’ or ‘unimportant’. It is just a technical qualification that
helps in further refining the tools of the analysis. By doing so we
overcome the seemingly erroneous titular claim that what would otherwise
pass as structure is in fact agency. We do not use outright paradoxes
like “structure is agency” without explaining their underlying
rationale. That would be frivolous. Easy to dismiss. What we are doing
instead is draw a subtle yet crucial distinction between <em>orders of
abstraction</em>.</p>

<p>We do not consider the polity as seen from the perspective of the
person, important as that undoubtedly is. We study it in total. Changing
the scope implies revising the categories germane to the methodological
framework. In this holistic approach, macro entities, systems such as
‘class’ or ‘market’, are very much agents of the overall political
organisation of human experience. By that we mean that they do not
“condition the behaviour of situational agents and patients”. Rather,
their own behaviour, which manifests as a concatenation of emergent
phenomena from the underlying relations of the individuals participating
in the system, impacts the political process while being conditioned by
the broader magnitudes—the methodological structure—of the polity: its
historical-cultural-institutional order and concomitant path
dependencies.</p>

<p>Even an outline of the specifics of a fine argument requires some
explanation. We assume the above to be adequate in resolving the
epistemological tension at hand. Proceeding to the salient point is in
order.</p>

<h3>Financialisation and global capital</h3>

<p>Financialisation is the process by which the economy becomes ever
dependent on the inner workings of the financial sector. Most economic
activities are either directly or indirectly contingent on finance. The
bank as an intermediary between savers and borrowers is not a new
institution. Financialisation is.</p>

<p>Finance’s role as the cornerstone of the economy is not down to the
‘invisible hand’ of the free market, whereby “free” implies an organic
state of affairs with no intervention from the state or any other
connection to political realities. Finance is at the epicentre in large
part because the prevailing conditions grant it that privileged
status. These may involve (i) outright privileges from the government
such as lower tax rates or lax regulation, (ii) beneficial treatment
such as in cases of financial duress (where the bank is bailed out but
not, say, the households that borrowed from it), (iii) unequal
distribution of the efficiency gains from globalisation.</p>

<p>While the former two are greatly important, their specifics vary
substantially depending on the jurisdiction concerned. The issue we may
therefore consider for the purposes of this book is the third one:
globalisation. What does this elusive concept actually stand for? What
is its economic actuality?</p>

<p>Globalisation is the process by which the political processes of the
world become ever interdependent and mutually aware, where trade attains
a global character especially as concerns its integration and evolution
into a systemic whole, and where there is an increasing sense of doing
politics for the general interests of the international community
at-large (currently on climate and to a lesser extent finance and
taxation, soon in other areas such as cyber). Globalisation is the
overarching theme of international relations. It essentially informs the
politics of the present. To be a part of the world or to attempt to
stand against the trends.</p>

<p>Globalisation is concurrent with—or contingent on—advances in
information technology. There is a sense of immediacy to it, which is
integral to the interconnectedness of the world. European citizens
would, for instance, have little direct insight into the inner workings
of the US presidential elections without the communication media
available at our disposal. Similarly, markets would be less responsive
to underlying economic changes as there would be a greater delay between
an event and its internalisation in the cost/risk assessment exercise.</p>

<p>As immediacy becomes prevalent the need for physical proximity
diminishes. Information technology effectively shrinks the space-time of
human experience. Data travels in an instant. Events on the other side
of the planet have a greater impact on domestic affairs than they
otherwise would. Everything feels closer. For big business this means
that they are not necessarily bound to any one place. Their holding
company can be situated far away from where most economic activity takes
place.</p>

<p>This opens up markets to global investment. It also contributes to the
greater exposure of the domestic economy to events abroad. The Great
Recession is a case in point. The burst of America’s property bubble had
a cascading effect on European markets in particular and the
international economy more generally. It exposed the fragility of
European banks, revealed the infamous ‘Greek statistics’, contributed to
the euro area’s sovereign debt and bank crisis, and so on.</p>

<p>From a political perspective, there are two points worth highlighting
before proceeding to analyse the overarching theme:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Too big to fail.</strong> Financial institutions are at the core of
economic activity. That alone makes them vital. They also expand
their investing/trading activities into markets that are not related
to the ‘real economy’: financial derivatives and the like. Eventually
they outgrow the very domestic economy in which they operate. The
authorities meant to regulate them are faced with a near impossible
task of tackling a global[ised] issue with purely national means.</li>
  <li><strong>State-bank symbiosis.</strong> Corruption and corporatism notwithstanding,
the interests of the state and the banks can be interwoven by
economic conditions. A financial institution that is deemed ‘too big
to fail’ is, in effect, treated as part of the state apparatus rather
than a typical private actor. An outright bailout from the sovereign
is the likely course of action. Private debt thus becomes public
debt. A sovereign debt crisis may ensue, as was the case in several
occasions amid the euro crisis. It then is the sovereign that needs
banks to ‘support’ it, in the form of credit (buy its sovereign debt
instruments).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Asymmetry and market accountability</h3>

<p>Market dynamics themselves forge a strong bond between the state and
financial institutions. But the relationship is not necessarily
symmetrical. The sovereign is a nation state. It does not have the
chance to reap the benefits of globalisation in the same way a
multinational corporation might. The nation state is largely static. It
can only impose taxes and regulations within its own
jurisdiction. Whereas the bank is more flexible and adaptable. It can
allocate capital across the globe, siphon profit through ‘favourable’
tax jurisdictions, partake in investment activities far from the base of
its holding company.</p>

<p>In short, the state is local, the bank global. Yet when the domestic
bank fails it is only up to the corresponding public authorities to act,
as if the problem is purely their own. In a narrow sense of which legal
order applies it certainly is. Though in the broader sense of the
underpinnings of the market failure at hand, there likely are
cross-border factors involved.</p>

<p>The gains of globalisation are not distributed evenly across
society. International trade does not benefit everyone in equal
proportion. Some lose other profit enormously. The latter group is
typically populated by businesses with a cross-border reach combined
with the means to exploit loopholes across multiple jurisdictions. The
more nuanced point is that the magnitudes of economic activity and
locality are decoupled. It is easier for private actors of this sort to
exert pressure on the government by effectively shifting their core
businesses to countries with more favourable regulations.</p>

<p>The most obvious challenge to public authority is on taxation. A nation
state cannot impose high tax rates or considerably broaden the tax base
without running the risk of losing the affected companies to more
‘competitive’ jurisdictions. Businesses with a global reach have the
option to relocate. The <em>effective</em> sovereignty of the state thus
diminishes. It formally remains the supreme authority. In practice there
is little it can do in its own right, at least less than what would be
wanted/needed.</p>

<p>Globalisation’s asymmetric distribution of resources has a profound
effect on the political process, more specifically with regard to the
accountability of public authorities. The body of citizens no longer is
the sole actor that checks on the government. Markets perform the same
function, albeit with different means.</p>

<p>Consider this example. The people of a relatively small economy elect a
government on a more progressive platform. To raise taxes on the rich,
expand social welfare, invest in public schools and healthcare,
etc. Voters will hold the government accountable on the basis of whether
it implements its agenda. Markets on the other hand will set their own
policy priorities. They may attach a greater risk to investments in that
country, demand higher risk premia for buying its sovereign debt, or
altogether threaten to channel investments into another country with a
less ‘socialist’ outlook. The state will either seek a compromise or
lose out to the market forces, because the latter have the upper hand
courtesy of globalisation.</p>

<p>States are not helpless though, provided they do not think of themselves
in isolationist terms. They can engage in international relations that
enhance their sovereignty by diminishing the flexibility of private
‘global’ actors. For instance, if large corporations move their profits
away from, say, Greece to Luxembourg, the solution is an EU-wide
initiative to harmonise corporate taxation throughout the single
market. The effective elimination of major aspects of fiscal competition
would force businesses with a cross-border reach into accepting the
rules imposed by the authorities.</p>

<p>The asymmetry of globalisation is, therefore, a transitory
phenomenon. It lies in the simple fact that the private sphere became
global while the public remained partially trapped in the traditional
conception of sovereignty as purely national. There is global
trade. There is no global government. Which creates a regulatory
disconnect. The magnitudes differ.</p>

<h3>Democratic sovereignty excludes market agency</h3>

<p>Democracy rests on the virtuous cycle of legitimation and accountability
between the state and the people. The latter provide the former with
their consent, which is necessary for rendering the legal order
acceptable and for granting the authorities the right to govern. At the
same time, it takes state fiat to qualify a group of people as
citizens. There is no citizenry in the absence of the relevant legal
provisions. No random person can participate in the affairs of a state.</p>

<p>Democracy thus represents a feedback loop between two facets of
sovereignty: (i) state and (ii) popular. The first consists in the
supremacy of the polity within its territorial confines. Its
independence and inherent capacity to exercise legitimate force for the
promotion of the general good (<em>for</em> the people). The second is the
normative foundation of democratic rule as bottom-up and participative
(<em>from</em> and <em>with</em> the people). It also contains the magma of norms and
unwritten rules—culture—that gets to inform, indeed mould, a certain
constitutional identity.</p>

<p>The market qua agent of politics does not fit into this cycle as it
operates at a different scale. That is so because democratic rule is
hitherto confined to a locale of sorts, typically the nation or the
instituted polity ‘stack’ of the nation plus the relevant supranational
stratum of politics. It is not globalised. The market is. That is
exactly why it can have a profound effect on the political process even
though it formally does not take part in it.</p>

<p>The market holds the authorities accountable by virtue of its capacity
to adapt to evolving circumstances throughout the planet. It essentially
has the power to escape the law and, in so doing, to pose its own
conditions on legislators. Without that ability it would, at most,
function as another source of information—a guide—on what the underlying
dynamics in the economy are. It would be complementary to quotidian
political affairs. Not a substitute of them.</p>

<h3>The asymmetry requires global coordination</h3>

<p>All phenomena are properly regulated at the level in which they
occur. Neighbourhood squabbles can be dealt with among
neighbours. Nation-wide issues call for central government
initiative. Continental and global challenges require international
cooperation. This is true for globalised capital just as it holds for
climate change and the emerging need to regulate cyberspace.</p>

<p>In the absence of concerted action on that front, multinational
corporations will continue to enjoy a disproportionate advantage of the
political sort. Their influence on the political process will remain
significant as well as loosely checked. Ultimately though, their
favourable status engenders in them a tendency to seek out alliances
with domestic politicians the world over. To foster or benefit from
corruption that is. In both normative and economic terms this is
suboptimal, indeed undesirable.</p>

<p>An ambitious roadmap for tackling the asymmetries of globalisation would
encompass at least the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Influential states, such as the USA or the EU, would lead by
example. They could proceed to stamp out any dubious tax regimes that
enable multinationals to effectively escape taxation. Macroprudential
policy and financial regulation in general would also be given
priority.</li>
  <li>International alliances would be forged on the basis of exchanging
information about registered companies, fiscal practices, and
financial oversight. The promotion of sound tax and bank policies
should also be prioritised.</li>
  <li>A global memorandum of understanding could be signed to the effect of
forcing all parties to insert a “symmetry clause” in any future
international treaty they sign. The clause would be a generic
commitment to regulate cross-border capital in a manner that is
consistent and beneficial for all states involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modalities and content may well vary. The idea is to make steps towards
the globalisation of the relevant politics. This is the only course of
action available for restoring markets to their original function as
hubs of economic activity with no immediate impact on the political
process. In the meantime, they will continue to operate as a political
actor towards which elected officials are held accountable without
sufficient reciprocity.</p>

<h2>On the political relevance of cyber</h2>

<p>The term “cyber” with its various derivatives is gradually becoming part
of political parlance. Usually it is in relation to some malicious
attempt to deny or sabotage an online service, leak sensitive
information from a remote database, and the like. Attackers of that sort
are often referred to as “hackers”, while their acts qualify as “cyber
attacks”. The discussion surrounding the topic is heavily influenced by
military notions of offence and defence, and by an emphasis on the kind
of issues peculiar to the maintenance of public order.</p>

<p>While there is truth to be had in those security-focused themes, cyber
cannot be conceived as merely another domain for the conduct of what
effectively amounts to war. A simple way of putting it is that cyber is
the extension of collective human experience in digital space,
complemented by the interaction between machines and
programmed/preconfigured logical processes. Apart from security, cyber
encompasses such issues as ethics, the distribution of power and control
among situational agents and patients, the presence of social-economic
hierarchies, and so on.</p>

<h3>What is cyber</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cyberspace:</strong> The notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs.<br />
— <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/cyberspace">Oxford
Dictionary</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These concepts are relatively novel. Their implications have not been
envisaged in their fullest. Policy-makers may lack the expert advice
necessary for legislating on the matter, or they still do not appreciate
its significance as a core item on the agenda. The law is lagging behind
technology, at least as far as the pace of change is concerned. New
inventions and innovative ways of organising labour and distributing the
product thereof often expose a certain disconnect between the physical
and the digital realms. The former remains wedded in political custom
and in traditional views about statehood, belonging, subjectivity,
ownership, and the like. The latter can be found exploring the outer
boundaries of such issues as individuality, property, agency, often
challenging their conventional value and overall usefulness as paradigms
for the new era.</p>

<p>We live in an age of transition. Cyber is pushing itself to the centre
of human society. Technological progress is such that there is a strong
sense of inevitability to it all. The Internet is ubiquitous and rapidly
evolving into a domain populated not just by humans accessing it through
personal computers, but by ‘connected devices’ (appliances such as the
fridge and the thermostat) that are programmed to retrieve remote data
in order to execute certain tasks. Many utilities and everyday
activities become digitised or have a software component attached to
them. The software is, generally speaking, designed to harness the
potential provided by a network of communications. It accesses the
network to interoperate with other pieces of software, its output
becoming the input of the other, with the ultimate objective of
automating repetitive activities, and of simulating human intelligence
in the anticipation of likely outcomes to evolving states of affairs.</p>

<p>The networks that emerge from the interplay between humans, machines and
their programs, form a space unlike anything we have experienced
before. This is not a tract of land that we can draw lines on, some
territory where we can maintain a standing army ready to fend off
incursions. Cyber is, first and foremost, a system of variables, with
their interactions unfolding at various levels of abstraction. It is
largely notional in that regard. Though ‘notional’ should not be thought
of as akin to ‘ethereal’, ‘magical’, or anything of the sort. The system
is comprehensible throughout, even though it is highly complex and
consists of numerous components that demand certain expertise to be
properly comprehended. Yet there are those qualities of cyber that
relate to social experience which require the same kind of political
thinking that applies to more familiar instances of quotidian public
life.</p>

<h3>Cyber for the people</h3>

<p>It is conceivable to think and speak about cyber without being a ‘nerd’,
‘hacker’, ‘technologist’. The lay person can perfectly understand topics
pertinent to cyber such as the diffusion or concentration of economic
power, the effective control of corporations—also known as “Internet
giants”—over large segments of online activity, mass surveillance by the
government, and things of that nature.</p>

<p>The first step to approaching cyber is to demystify it. Yes, technical
insight into anything that has to do with computers and software
requires a certain set of advanced skills that take years to acquire and
master. Indeed the number of people who can provide expertise on the
finer points are but a small minority. However, the same kind of
argument can be forwarded for virtually every area of
policy. Agriculture has its experts. Law. Economics. The
military. Whatever their peculiarities, these are not excluded from the
political process. Citizens and their representatives maintain their
views on those issues; views that often translate into legislative
action and/or policy initiatives from the government. Cyber can be no
different.</p>

<p>The second step to approach the subject is to consider cyber’s emergence
and presence in light of everyday experience, of its impact on ordinary
life. For instance, every labourer knows what widespread automation can
do to their work prospects. By using that which is immediate, we can
fathom the ramifications of digitisation in the workplace, family life,
the political process and governance, social stratification, the
distribution of power within and across states. It is, in other words,
to identify the social-cultural-historical change brought by cyber and
to recognise—or attempt to anticipate—the structures derived therefrom.</p>

<p>The political talk on cyber is not about the technicalities that the
developer or the engineer has to deal with. It concerns the effects of
this new domain of human invention on social organisation. Cyber is, as
we posited in the introduction to this chapter, the <em>digital extension
of collective human experience</em> and, therefore, yet another dimension of
the exercise of political authority. As such, it needs to be understood,
regulated and managed just as every other aspect of human venture,
rather than be left open to the major [corporate] interests now active
in the field.</p>

<h3>Cyber extends to physical space</h3>

<p>To this end, we need to broaden the definition furnished above. Though
technically correct, it is too narrow for our politically-focused
analysis. Cyberspace is not merely notional or, rather, it is not
realisable in purely notional terms. In essence, cyber and its space
consists of two magnitudes: (i) hardware, (ii) software. There are data
centres, power supply chains, local and remote computers, and whatever
other ‘connected’ device may form part of the network (or network of
networks).</p>

<p>Hardware-wise, cyber is a decentralised system that is ultimately
present in physical space. Hardware is the platform where software can
function. It also is the object on which software may iterate,
potentially to affect its <em>modality</em>, its state of being.</p>

<p>To elaborate on the latter, let us consider the following example. Your
computer runs an Operating System (Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS,
etc.). It is the software infrastructure on which applications such as
your web browser, text editor, music player, etc., get to run on. Very
simply put, your computer is an abstract structure consisting of three
layers: the hardware, the OS at the software’s base, the apps at the
top. An integral part of the OS is a program known as the “kernel”. It
manages memory usage, input and output devices, and the like. Your mouse
and keyboard, the monitor, the stereo speakers. These all work thanks to
the kernel. And obviously because programs are programmable, the kernel
can also be instructed to do certain things, such as not to allocate
sufficient memory for a certain task, or not to send the necessary
signal to the monitor. You get the idea. Software gets to affect the
state of the hardware, while hardware defines the potential of the
software, presenting us with an organic whole.</p>

<p>If we extend this to computer networks and software stacks (layers of
abstraction each with an ever more specialised function), we get a
multidimensional system whose <em>inner workings</em> happen in conceptual
space, yet whose <em>ultimate impact</em> is made manifest physically.</p>

<p>A working definition of <strong>cyberspace</strong> can, therefore, be formulated
thus: <em>a multifaceted architecture for creating, storing, communicating,
and managing data and for influencing the state of any physical entity
or resource ultimately linked to it</em>.</p>

<p>Here is a scenario to emphasise the physical aspect of cyber. Imagine an
electricity authority that wants to optimise the way it handles power
production. Its engineers have developed a program that uses several
indicators to determine the scale of operations. When consumers turn on
their air conditioners at peak hours the program responds by producing
the additional electricity. It automatically scales back when usage
falls to a lower point. There is no need to have humans manually control
switches. The program does that 24/7 with no delays whatsoever. The
efficiency gains for the electricity authority and ultimately the cost
savings for the consumer are considerable. Now imagine some attacker
wanting to disrupt the power supply. Assuming they bypass the security
checks, they could write/inject the necessary code (set of formalised
logical commands) that would confuse the program or make it do something
that was not originally intended, such as over- or under- supply
electricity, to the point of causing physical harm to the electricity
network.<sup id="fnref:BotnetDDoS" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:BotnetDDoS" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Data channels are notional. Their underlying infrastructure is
physical. Extend this to traffic lights, the water supply,
telecommunications, whatever connected device you [will] have at home
such as your thermostat, fridge, toaster, and you can fathom the extent
to which software impacts ‘reality’.</p>

<h3>Cyber solidity through the rule of law</h3>

<p>Cyber is another domain for the exercise of supreme authority,
sovereignty. Unlike the magnitudes of land, sea, and air, the space
resulting from the networks of humans, machines and their programs is
largely notional. Traditional concepts of drawing borders are of no use,
at least not in the context of an open Internet. So how may a polity
proceed to delineate its “territory”, the province of its jurisdiction,
in such an environment? The answer is to be found in cyber’s ultimate
connection to physical reality. Data centres are located somewhere. They
are governed by a certain legal order, as do the natural/legal persons
that eventually get to use them.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter we posited the rule of law as a factor of
sovereignty. The effective exercise of control rests on the integrity of
the legal order. Its universality, reasonableness, and predictability. A
stable legal framework strengthens the people’s trust in their
polity. It fosters a strong connection between the government and the
citizens that ultimately stand to gain from an intrinsically reliable
system. Citizens must trust the law in order for the public institutions
to exercise effective sovereignty. By extension, they need to have
confidence in the capacity of law makers to provide for a secure and
impartial field when it comes to a domain such as cyber that greatly
influences their livelihood.</p>

<p>The entire architecture that provides for the emergence of social
experiences in digital space needs to be brought in line with the
highest possible legal standard. Citizens and businesses alike can
expect nothing less than a robust system on which to base a great[er]
portion of their individual and social activity. The state regulates
other key areas of daily life, such as the financial system which is
central to virtually every business transaction. Telecommunications,
education, social welfare also fall in that category. The authorities
cannot afford to abstain from setting the criteria for the security and
protection of data, data centres, networks, and so on. These are
critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>A robust legal framework in the realm of cyber must consist of two
tiers: (i) global principles, (ii) domestic legislation. As concerns the
former, international agreements need to be formulated to the effect of
providing guidelines for local authorities to put into law. This would
be similar to the approach followed on bank supervision and prudential
policy. The ambition is to lay the groundwork for the mutual enhancement
of soveregnties through improvements in the overall intergrity of a
truly global system. Domestic legislation will then provide for the
specifics of self-determination. To ensure that the rules satisfy the
needs of the polity and are aligned with its constitutional tradition.</p>

<p>The right legal framework can create the economic conditions/incentives
that will make it profitable to consider security an integral part of
everything related to cyber, from the hardware to the software. The
solidity of cyber will not happen serendipitously. It requires concerted
efforts. To disincentivise bad coding, manufacturing, marketing
practices that render the system fragile. To set the criteria and the
direction. For cyber is an extension of the polity’s province of
legality. It has to exhibit predictability and reasonableness in the
same way the rest of the legal order does.</p>

<h3>FOSS can secure public authorities</h3>

<p>It is typical for public authorities to run some old version of a
commercial Operating System (OS), typically Microsoft Windows. The way
software is rendered secure is through ‘patches’. New code that
addresses a specific vulnerability. Support for old software is not
readily available. It requires specialised teams or a bespoke setup for
handling its vulnerabilities. That is inefficient, expensive, and
usually implies that the authorities are dependent on an external
service provider, including the creator of the OS.</p>

<p>Free and open source software (FOSS) can provide a secure and in many
ways superior alternative. We will use Linux as a case in
point.<sup id="fnref:CLIToolsPost" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:CLIToolsPost" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> This is a type of OS that is developed in an open,
decentralised, and peer-reviewed fashion. There are many distributions
or distros of Linux. Each caters to the specific needs of its target
audience. For example, <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is the
benchmark for many use cases. <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>
is for the super-tech-savvy. <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> is the
standard of stability and ease of
use. <a href="https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html">Tails</a> is for those who
require the highest degree of privacy.</p>

<p>It may seem counter-intuitive to suggest that an open code base is more
secure than a closed one. The weaknesses of the former can be seen by
everyone. Those of the latter can only be known by those with access to
it. Or so it is thought. In fact these can be traced just as well. What
this line of reasoning misses is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> The paradigm of FOSS is that of an altogether
different way of doing business. It is based on collaboration and the
dissemination of knowledge. Sharing makes everyone better off. Whereas
the proprietary model is predicated on the artificial scarcity created
by copyright law. It gains from secrecy, obscurity, and the
obfuscation of certain truths.</li>
  <li><strong>Perverse incentives.</strong> Because the proprietary model draws its
competitiveness from a spirit of secrecy, a corporation might have the
perverse incentive not to disclose/acknowledge any vulnerability to
its product. In contradistinction, FOSS will get to be updated almost
immediately. As soon as the weakness is identified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Openness is not a security liability. It is an asset. There are more
people looking at the code and auditing it. Their interests, at least
for the majority of them, are those of the community. To have a stable
and reliable system.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the polity that is a potential bonus. A public
entity can be instituted to the effect that it works full time on the
government’s various FOSS projects. Let us call it the ‘Digital
Transition Unit’ headed by the ‘Information Ministry’. The Unit can work
on existing code to optimise it for the specific needs of the state. Its
efforts will be complementary to those of the open source community. It
will even give back to the community whenever it adds a new feature or
tackles some security vulnerability.</p>

<p>Public funds will thus be directed to distributed projects that (i) have
no ‘backdoors’, (ii) are not controlled by a single corporation, (iii)
may be audited by security researchers across the globe, (iv) come with
a license that does not bind the state to the agenda of some private
actor. Public money for the promotion of the public interest.</p>

<p>Imagine the world’s most affluent states making such a commitment. The
efficiency gains for everyone involved would be tremendous. Obviously
FOSS is not appropriate for everything the state does. The military and
security agencies will require some bespoke system. However, many of the
state’s needs are well covered by software of this sort. Anything that
has a positive effect on the state’s security and on the solidity of its
connection to cyberspace has to be prioritised as a matter of
reinforcing a factor of effective sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Cyber is central</h3>

<p>The fact that an entire chapter of a series about sovereignty is
dedicated to <em>what</em> cyber is and <em>why</em> it may be relevant in a political
context, goes to show that the topic has still not fully entered the
public mind. To the lay person all this may come across as “tech stuff
for geeks”. Even so, cyber’s technical nature does not <em>necessarily</em>
render its actual organisation morally neutral or values-free. Nor does
it mean that it has no implications whatsoever on the commons.</p>

<p>Cyber is relevant to politics by virtue of the fact that software with
the capacity to connect to a remote network has become the irreducible
factor of an ever growing number of activities and social
experiences. Whatever gets to somehow condition or otherwise influence
relations between people must be subject to public debate and
scrutiny. The general points aside, there are some more specific reasons
as to why the topic is relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Economics.</strong> Depending on the licensing framework and the
incentives’ structure derived therefrom, certain markets emerge
(markets do not exist in an institutional vacuum or in a rules-free,
decontextualised domain). The gains are distributed accordingly, which
means that hierarchies and social structures may be established that
provide advantages to certain groups over others. Issues such as
fairness and equality of opportunity naturally arise.</li>
  <li><strong>Security.</strong> This can be considered in the form of homeland security
but also of the privacy of households/individuals. The integrity of
cyber is of utmost importance to ensure that every activity contingent
on it is carried out as intended (e.g. the power supply mentioned
above, or your ‘smart’ thermostat not leaking your home’s sensitive
data). Without appropriate measures such as a robust legal framework
for fostering bottom-up practices for protecting the space, the
damages can be far-reaching, the effects particularly deleterious.</li>
  <li><strong>Governance.</strong> Given the nature of cyber as a form of shared
infrastructure, it can potentially impact two types of businesses and
social relations: (i) those whose starting point is cyber and (ii) the
ones that have an indirect connection to the ‘tech industry’ by virtue
of using some digital tool or service. As such, the specifics of cyber
have to be regulated in light of the general interest, with the space
<em>as such</em> being considered a public good.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that a degree of technical knowledge is required to grasp the
finer points of cyber should not be a reason to keep the discussion
confined to an inner circle of specialists. Every area of expertise has
aspects that are not immediately accessible to the uninitiated. That
does not render them immune to criticism or conceal them from the public
purview. Besides, that is where journalists, bloggers, and independent
analysts/commentators come in to communicate the information demanded by
the general population in a form that is accessible. The danger of
considering something to be too technical and thus obscure is that the
dominant forces operating within the system may find ways to exploit the
public’s indifference, much to the detriment of the public interest.</p>

<p>A polity that seeks to exercise control over the means of governance,
the factors of its effective sovereignty, must recognise in cyber a
domain that needs to be aligned with its general political direction.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and special thanks</h2>

<p><em>Essays on Sovereignty</em> is referred to as a ‘book’ for the sake of
convenience. A more appropriate description would be a collection of
articles that share a common theme. The distinction is subtle, just like
many of the points covered herein. It is meant to suggest that the parts
of this piece of labour can stand on their own right, save some
references to their context (e.g. “in the previous chapter…”).</p>

<p>Articles such as the <em>Factors of effective sovereignty</em>, <em>The market as
a political agent</em>, <em>On self-determination</em> could easily be posted as
standalone blog posts. Reading them on their own will not detract from
the analysis into their individual issues. But just like society, where
each individual person can be treated in their own right, one may not
appreciate the full extent of certain features without reference to the
environing whole.</p>

<p>Reading these essays as a collection will deliver different results than
seeing each item in isolation. It is like when you start connecting
dots. The dots and the lines you draw can be seen in themselves as dots
and lines. Take a step back, ‘zoom out’ as it were, and you may be
looking at an altogether different figure.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, conclusions about a subject of inquiry come down to
perspective, to the method used. Examine the underlying methodology,
shift things around and you might gain a new insight into the topic at
hand. That is kind of what this book is all about. In a sense there is
nothing new presented here. Sovereignty, cyber, globalisation, and every
other concept are well-documented, and by authors with a better grasp of
the issues than yours truly. And yet the attentive reader may find
snippets of original thinking, from the very approach to each topic to
the content discussed therein. Again, perspective comes into play.</p>

<p>The emphasis on how one sees things should not be considered a form of
metaphysical relativism. The suggestion is not that objective truths are
an illusion since “everything is a matter of perspective”. The point is
far more subtle. Epistemological. It is about the most appropriate means
to revealing the actuality of a certain case in its given constitution,
at the level of abstraction in which it is rendered intelligible. An
emergent phenomenon cannot be properly understood by studying only its
foundational level. The domain where emergence reveals itself is where
the core of the study ought to be.</p>

<p>This sort of ‘methodological awareness’ as it were characterises much of
the <em>Essays</em>. The reason is rather simple: to avoid creating
confusion. Topics such as globalisation, the role of financial markets,
sovereignty, are more or less common in political palaver. They carry
certain connotations that could engender unintended conclusions if not
properly removed from the scope of the analysis. For instance, the
argument that the market is a political agent, can be prima facie
dismissed as a naive contradiction. “Prima facie” typically is the
instance when one exposes their previously held notions. The explanation
into the approach helps them escape from those confines or otherwise
appreciate things under a different light.</p>

<p>The vast corpus of <em>Essays on Sovereignty</em> is dedicated to the inquiry
into theoretical topics. It may, therefore, not be the most fun thing to
read. This is not a manual on some of the technical challenges to the
enforcement of sovereign authority in the 21st century. It may not be
the book you would recommend to your practically-minded friend. It is a
collection of open-ended ideas about some of the fundamentals of
political organisation. The book does not purport to be anything more
than a proposal on considering its themes in the way suggested in each
chapter. It is an invitation to think along those lines.</p>

<p>Theoretical work does not yield immediate results. It is not like with a
manifesto that compels one into action based mostly on their
predispositions. We think before we venture forward in an attempt to
ultimately set the right goals, pursue the most appropriate course of
action, employ the best means available, and so on. Though always with
the understanding that our theory may be muddled, far from complete,
and, hence, subject to revision.</p>

<p>By keeping the analysis at the highly theoretical level, I have tried to
examine the most basic issues, those that are likely to be found in an
extended multitude of actual cases. This lays the foundations for more
work to be done into the specifics. If, say, I write a blog post about
globalisation or cyberspace, I can expand on what was presented in this
book. If you are a concerned citizen, then perhaps seeing the market as
a political agent may provide you with a starting point on seeking some
alternative, some kind of reform. And so on. <em>Essays on Sovereignty</em> is
a point of reference in an endless cycle of research. It is neither a
beginning nor an end in a linear process.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to comment on my hope with publishing this book. No, it
is not about persuading the reader to become a theorist. I do not give
theory more importance than practicality. None of that. The hope is that
we sometimes take a step back from what is seemingly obvious,
self-evident, and crystal clear, to check whether we are doing our cause
any real service. We may extol the virtues of a given plan or criticise
some state of affairs. Fair enough. It seldom hurts to think things
through.</p>

      <p>That the content of language could be
considered differently does not mean that language is a collection
of arbitrary sounds and/or signs. As we can see from programming
languages where it usually is one person or a small group that
develops them, the language still needs to have internal coherence
in its syntax and grammar. It still needs to distinguish between an
object and its qualities, a variable and a constant, a process and a
product, etc. <a href="#fnref:LanguageArbitrariness" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">[^]</a></p>
