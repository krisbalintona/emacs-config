         <p>In this short video I show how to make use of the keyboard macro
counter.  This is a very specialised piece of functionality that is
built into Emacs.</p>

<p>I show once again what I demonstrated in the <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-08-22-emacs-kmacro-counter/">previous demo on the
subject</a>
and then discuss how to improve on that experience: simplify the key
bindings and make the process faster.</p>

<p>And here is my dotemacs, in case you are interested:
