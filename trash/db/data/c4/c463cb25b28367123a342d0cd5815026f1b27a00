         
         <p>I decided to maintain my own fork of Lemonbar with support for Xft,
because GitHub user <em>krypt-n</em> <a href="https://github.com/krypt-n/bar/pull/37#issuecomment-473265449">seems to have lost
interest</a>
in their project.</p>

<p>My fork is on GitLab:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lemonbar-xft">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lemonbar-xft</a>.
Here I want to tell you the steps I followed to produce it.</p>

<p>Start by cloning upstream (all my links will be for SSH connections,
which require an appropriately-configured GitHub account):</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:LemonBoy/bar.git ~/lemonbar-upstream
</code></pre>

<p>Now also clone the fork with Xft support:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:krypt-n/bar.git ~/lemonbar-xft-discontinued
</code></pre>

<p>Switch to the upstream repo:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/lemonbar-upstream
</code></pre>

<p>Prepare to pull in the Xft fork:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add xft ~/lemonbar-xft-discontinued
git fetch xft
</code></pre>

<p>Now create a new branch with the fork:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b xft-port
</code></pre>

<p>Then merge <code>master</code> into <code>xft-port</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git merge master
</code></pre>

<p>You are mostly done.  I just added an extra file that explains what this
fork is about.  It is named “README-xft” and has the following:</p>

<pre><code>Personal fork of Lemonbar with Xft support
==========================================

The purpose of this fork is to keep up with upstream while maintaining
the changes by GitHub user krypt-n who seems to have lots interest in
the project.[0]

The contributions by krypt-n allow Xft support (to use typefaces
supported by fontconfig).  Upstream Lemonbar appears to be unable or
unwilling to merge them into master.[1]

I have decided to maintain this project, because I want to use it as
part of my custom desktop session on Debian 10 Buster.[2]

</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, I did the following to push my fork to GitLab:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add lemonbar-xft-current git@gitlab.com:protesilaos/lemonbar-xft.git
git push -u lemonbar-xft-current --all
</code></pre>

<p>Done!  Read my previous entry on <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-06-23-lemonbar-xft-new/">how to compile this fork on Debian 10
Buster</a>.</p>
