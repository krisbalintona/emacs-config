         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate how to use <code>magit</code>, the <em>superb</em> git
porcelain for Emacs, to interactively re-base your commits before
pushing them to the remote repository.  This is a good way of rewriting
your local branchâ€™s history, so as to keep things clean and make them
easier to understand.</p>

<p>Also check my other short video on the same principle: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-11-27-emacs-magit-commit-fixup/">git commit fixup
with
Magit</a>.</p>
