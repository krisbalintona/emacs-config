         <p>In this screen cast I showcase the potential of combining <code>dired</code>, the
built-in Emacs file manager, with keyboard macros.  This allows us to
perform an arbitrary number of tasks in a collection of files that are
grouped together as a directory or dynamically (with search tools like
<code>find-name-dired</code>).</p>

<p>The idea is that we can use keyboard macros to perform changes
visually across all our files, without having to think about complex
regular expressions for the necessary search+replace actions.</p>

<p>And here is my own config file, with tweaks for Dired and others:
