         <p>In this screen cast I showcase the working prototype of a script I wrote
that allows us to operate on multiple selectors in order to accomplish
complex tasks.  As with the rest of the session, everything is part of
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure to check my dotfiles as the script will be updated with more
features than those demonstrated in the screen cast.</strong></p>
