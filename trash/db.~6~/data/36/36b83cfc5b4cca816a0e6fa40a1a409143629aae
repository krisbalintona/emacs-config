<p><strong>A.:</strong> I am so happy to be on this business trip.  Three days on the
countryside are exactly what I needed for a change of scenery.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Sure, the place is nice.  It is a bit cold, though I still went
for a swim at dawn.  I was just too curious about the North Sea.  That
aside, we still are here for work, which means that most of our waking
hours will be committed to what we always do.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> The trick is to have fun during those moments you are awake
without being at the job.  Just like your rather reckless excursion to
the beach.  “A bit cold” is a massive understatement.  It is cloudy, the
wind speed has picked up, and it looks like it will rain any moment now.
Thankfully we are indoors.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> No worries: I got what I wanted.  You are right though, I did
not mean to sound negative about the fact that we are here.  I am glad
that we get the chance to change scenes.  Besides, this is the first
time we sit together without doing any kind of work.  Weird, isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> It is!  I saw you walking by and just had to invite you to sit
here.  I have been here before.  It is cosy and I like to feel its
warmth, its comfort before heading to the office.  Plus this is my
chance to get to know you better.  You are always so professional and
discreet, seemingly detached from the world around you.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> It sure is a welcoming establishment.  There must be a history
to it.  But I am not here for that.  I accepted your invitation as I was
simply walking around the area in search of nothing in particular.
Would you care to elaborate on what you think contributes to my
discreetness and professionalism?  To this apparent aloofness that you
have spotted?  It will help me answer your questions about who I am.  Is
that not what you want?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Do you feel comfortable being here?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> All good.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Do you mind if I make some private questions and provide
relevant observations?  I don’t mean to be bad or unsettle you.  It just
is that someone has to make a start.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Please go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I have noticed that you never express any sort of interest in
your colleagues’ personal lives.  It is typical for people in our
workplace to get to know each other by sharing their experiences.  This
happens at the coffee table, during lunch, or on Friday evenings and
over the weekends in after-work gatherings…  We are all friends here.
You are the only one missing.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> …</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Do you follow me.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I am listening to every single word.  Please continue.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I hope I am not being pushy here.  You are so quiet.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> All is good.  Perhaps you are just not used to someone listening
to you.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Okay.  I was basically saying that you are removed from the rest
of us.  You don’t drink coffee, so you never attend those short breaks.
You prepare food at home and won’t join us at the restaurant.  And I
have not spotted you around in after-work hours, not even once after all
these months, whereas I have met all the others.  It is a small city
back where we live, which leads me to believe that you withdraw into
your shell.  At this point, I would not be surprised if you also do not
consume alcohol.  While those may be your choices, which I would not
judge, it seems you have a hard time adjusting to this life style and
have not made any friends to ease the transition.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> You sure are perceptive.  Indeed, I do not drink coffee and
alcohol and generally am very disciplined and particular with what I
consume.  It would be impossible for me to think about all those things,
from metaphysics to epistemology, to ethics, politics, and the human
condition, and yet have nothing to say about those items which are
essential to my quotidian experience: food and drink.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I was aware that you are the philosopher type.  Not from you, of
course, but from your colleagues that work directly with you.  Though
the way you speak, your body language, makes this easy to spot.  I know
nothing about philosophy, so please don’t overwhelm me with it.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> No stress.  I also don’t know anything about it.</p>

<p>[ Read: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-06-15-quest-truth/">Why I won’t join your
club</a>
(2021-06-15) ]</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Strange.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I am here to answer your questions.  And did I just hear that
you will buy me a herbal tea?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Oh yes, sorry about that!  I’ll see to it.  Please continue.
You were saying that you are mindful of your consumption.  What about
socialising with us?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> The excuse is that I do not join your coffee breaks because I do
not drink coffee.  And I do not come at your parties because I do not
consume alcohol.  I could just leave it at that and tell you to simply
take it for what it is.  But the truth is that I feel no need to be with
you all.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You don’t like people or noise?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Those are not the same.  I do like people, especially when I am
not paying for it!  Ha!  And I can tolerate noise.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> What am I missing then?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> You think that everyone is like you.  That we all draw energy
and excitement by being with others the whole time.  Let’s say I ask you
now about your private life.  Any of those usual questions.  What will
be your follow-up question once you answer mine?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Maybe “how about you?” in an attempt to keep the dialogue going?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Exactly!  There is an element of reciprocity at play.  I will
ask you, then you will ask me back.  And when I provide an answer,
perhaps one you do not expect, you will inquire as to why that is.  Not
only will the discussion enter into private territory, it will likely
invoke comparisons with other peoples’ stories, which means that I will
be hearing not just your account of events, but also a curated view of
everybody else’s.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> That is how it usually goes.  It is necessary in order to
connect with each other.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Then we can work our way backwards.  If this is how we connect,
and if I never join your meetings, it means that I am not excited by
those kinds of conversations and do not think of connecting in that
particular way as necessary or beneficial to me.  Those talks tire me
out, as I have to expend all my energy on topics I find uninteresting.
I don’t care about your romantic escapades, not you right here, just the
general “you”.  And I most certainly have zero interest in the details
of your sex life.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I will not press on with that, if it makes you feel
uncomfortable.  Do you want to continue talking to me, or is that also
troublesome.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Let’s continue, as you consider this an opportunity to learn
something about me.  We will soon know whether you discover something
new about you instead.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I’m not sure what that is supposed to mean.  Are you always
cryptic like that?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> This is not a trick.  I am just noting that a conversation can
often shed light on corners of our world we are unaware of.  It may
reveal insights that have the potential to change how we approach
certain issues.  There is a chance that your life might move in another
direction afterwards.  The change might be barely noticeable at first,
like a two degree adjustment in an aeroplane’s flight which ultimately
takes it to an altogether different destination.  The alteration in
course might set in motion a series of cascading events that will
manifest as a larger shift in attitude and outlook.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> That is still too abstract for me.  I am more of an activist,
working with actual people.  Not to imply that your take is wrong or
somehow inadequate.  There is a contrast with what I do.  That’s all.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I am also interested in actual people.  Have you found any?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Another tricky question!  Either you are teasing me all along or
you have some other definition in mind.  I meant that I work with people
everyday and we deal with tangible issues.  You know, their needs for
shelter, a stable and fulfilling job, putting food on the table.  That
sort of thing.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I understood that well.  What I meant is that it is hard to find
someone who is not behaving in accordance with the rules and norms that
are specific to each place.  Notice how we got started with this.  You
traced patterns in my behaviour that did not conform with the
expectations you have formed at the workplace.  For instance, you
observed correctly that I do not drink coffee with you like the rest of
the group.  While you did not state it explicitly, that struck you as
odd, as something being amiss.  It triggered your curiosity until you
eventually summoned me to your table.  You wondered what may be
contributing to that apparent non-conformity with the established norms
of conduct.  Those rules may be tacit, but you already understand them
as present, as being in effect.  And so you were intrigued when the
seemingly universal law turned out to have exceptions to it.</p>

<p>[ Read: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/2021-06-05-why-you-never-call-me/">Why I never call
you</a>
(2021-06-05) ]</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Yes, I noticed you were doing your own thing and wanted to know
whether you had adjustment problems.  I assumed it would be that,
because you do not seem to hold a grudge or harbour ill feelings.
Either way, I am here to help.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> In your case, you hypothesised as much.  In general though,
those inferences could vary considerably.  What is constant in the
multitude is the functioning of two magnitudes: (i) the severally and
often passively enforced rulebook of sociability within the given
milieu, and (ii) the assumption of irregularity when the rules fail to
apply.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Interesting.  Where do you want to go with that?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> If I were to conform with the rules, would I be here holding
this kind of discussion?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You could be here now because we would have become friends
sooner, rather than just being colleagues.  Though I suppose we would be
discussing other topics than what we currently cover.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Let’s probe deeper into this theme.  If I were to act in
accordance with the prevailing norms, I would be behaving in a manner
that was consistent with the applicable expectations.  Right?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Correct.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Would that person, who would essentially be acting contrary to
their own volition, be true to their self?  Would I be me, if I were
acting unlike me?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Is this not a trivial issue though?  Are you saying that a
simple coffee break would affect your personality or something?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> We invoke the coffee break as an example.  It is not the only
thing that you had noticed.  Apart from the coffee, we have lunch, the
after-work gatherings, and if we were to continue with our search we
would find all sorts of other scenaria that can be described in terms of
those implicit “rules of the game” that I am alluding to.  So please
answer my question: if I were to follow the rules despite the fact that
I do not express myself that way, would I still be operating like me?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> No, you would be something between your real “you” and the one
that makes a compromise to sit at our table.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Very well.  The differentiation means that I would not be me.
And if we were to extend this to every aspect of life, I would always be
a “compromise”, as you put it, between my underlying self and whatever
finds currency in the particular case.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I see how that goes.  Why are we discussing this?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Because I was curious about the “actual people” you encounter in
your day-to-day activism.  If everyone is behaving unlike who they
really are, then we have a problem of indeterminacy.  What is the
regular and what the irregular?  Which is the real you?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You have clearly thought this more than I.  I just wanted to
make you feel comfortable and be friendly.  I now understand what you
meant when you said you are interested in actual people.  My immediate
reaction would be that you are overthinking it, though upon second
thought I feel you are up to something.  I can already tell that you
have better reasons to behave the way you do and are not simply
struggling to adapt to life here.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> The two are not mutually exclusive.  You can still be yourself
and struggle to adapt because you face social pressure to fit in and
behave like everybody else.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I understand.  Once you get started, things will improve over
time.  The key is to take it slow and be relaxed about it.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Good.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Do you see that girl walking up the street?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Do you know who she is?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Does she?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> …</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Don’t give me that look.  I am just teasing you.  I know she
works with us.  Nothing more.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> She is a good friend of mine.  She can’t be with us right now as
she has an appointment.  We seem to be lucky in that regard, because our
work starts a bit later in the day.  Anyhow, we can join her later, if
you want.  Don’t you think she’s cute?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I don’t know why you are already counting me in, but I’ll tag
along since we are here.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You didn’t answer my question…</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I thought we were talking about a human being and then you asked
me if she is cute.  To me “cute” does not trigger a response.  A doll is
cute and she is not one.  A pet is cute and she is not one.  How about
“interesting”?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Whatever works for you.  Interesting in what way?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> It’s your friend and you are bringing her into this discussion.
I will play your game though I am telling you in advance that I will not
join you later.  No hard feelings, I have already planned to visit some
sites in the area.  I won’t tell you which ones, as it does not add
anything to our discussion.  To your point.  Is she merely cute or does
she have something else that defines her?  Maybe she enjoys books.
Perhaps she is a long distance runner.  She could be a comedian or a
volunteer in her local commune.  I don’t know.  Is there something else
about her as a person?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> She has lots of talents.  Plays saxophone and writes poems.  And
she speaks four languages—all fluently.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> So why did you bring up cuteness?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I don’t know, to be perfectly honest.  It was spontaneous.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> You do, though you may have not realised it yet because all
those coffee breaks—and I am being schematic here with “coffee breaks”
to cut the long story short—have conditioned you to act in a certain
way.  You assumed another normality where people of a given gender are
supposed to behave in a predictable way.  You know what stereotype I am
referring to.  You looked at me and surmised that I am part of that
group, and since they are all supposed to be the same, you reached an
early conclusion.  The train of thought led you to believe that I would
be excited to speak my mind about her cuteness or the lack thereof.
Then you added the bait: you mentioned the chance of meeting her later
in the day, with you being her close friend, implying that if I found
her cute I would be given the unique chance to act on that, especially
in light of where we are, far from our base of operations.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> …</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Take your time.  I am not blaming you for anything.  I just
showed you a part of you that was hitherto obscured by your conformity
with the socially sanctioned roles you assume in each case.  I had
already told you going into this discussion that you might figure out
something about yourself and your initial reaction was that I was
playing tricks and being cryptic.  No problem, I get that a lot.</p>

<p>[ Read: <a href="2021-04-15 On role and actuality">On role and actuality</a>
(2021-04-15) ]</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I now realise that.  And I can clearly tell that you are not the
silent type after all.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I am silent when the discussion is pointless and/or when no one
is listening.  You were kind enough to invite me to your table and buy
me a cup of tea.  I am enjoying the conversation we have.  Don’t worry
if you start to feel awkward about what you found out.  Your confusion
stems from the fact that you are not used to anyone actually listening
to what you say and discerning the intent behind your words and the
overarching framework that informs them.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You have this way of talking in paragraphs about abstract things
and I have trouble keeping up.  I still don’t know what you think of my
friend.  Can we go back to that?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I wanted to explain how her cuteness is irrelevant.  By bringing
that up you unintentionally reduced her to a fraction of her self.  What
kind of person would that attract?  She is not a doll.  She is a fully
fledged human being.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I just had to start from somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I understand.  Though I can already tell that you are
contemplating what I have shown you and will think twice before starting
from that point again.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> You are one stubborn fellow.  Though in a good kind of way.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Do you want to learn more?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Sure.  About what?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> About how you tried to present your friend to me.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I apologise.  She is my friend and I did not mean to belittle
her.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> There is no need to be sorry about what effectively is a mimetic
behaviour you were unaware of.  You did what would otherwise be passed
off as normal.  Only you had the tough luck, or blessing in disguise if
you will, to run across an immovable object.  Just relax and let me
regale you with my analysis of this.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Well, I brought that upon myself, didn’t I?  I thought I would
avoid the philosophising by bringing up my friend.  You evaded that and
now have turned the discussion to where you wanted it to move towards.
Please go on, but be mindful that I may have trouble with weird
terminology.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> A fully fledged human being is more than just their appearance.
They are a rich and complex world.  Humans have carnal desires, like the
need to eat or the sex drive.  Your allusion to cuteness was a hint at
the latter.  The body pertains to our overall health and I would group
it together with our psychological/emotional state as two sides of the
same coin.  So what we eat, think, breath are all relevant, as well as
how we expend our energy and interact with others as the social species
we are.  Continuing, we also have an aesthetic side, which we cultivate
by engaging with art, whether by taking it from others or producing it
ourselves.  Then there is the intellectual aspect, which we stimulate by
reading, by thinking things through, and by adding structure to our
thoughts.  Finally, there is the mystical dimension, as a potentiality
of ours that we need to develop considerably before it is rendered
salient.  In practice all those are part of us in a singular form,
though I present them here as analytical constructs just so we may
reason about them.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Interesting.  I am way out of my depth here.  You have to take
things slowly.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> That’s fine.  You are eager to learn, which again shows
something you may not be aware about yourself.  The point is that every
human is different.  Think about one’s physical attributes.  If you map
them across dimensions such as strength, endurance, speed, you will find
that some are inclined to score higher at certain metrics, while none
are the same in terms of distribution.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Obviously.  We see it with professional athletes, such as in
team sports.  They are all subjected to the same training regime, but
not everyone can perform equally across all those metrics.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Correct.  Well, the same is true about everything I mentioned.
Some are inclined to connect with others at an emotional level, others
have exceptional aesthetic sensitivities, while others are drawn towards
intellectual pursuits.  In practice, everyone is a bit of everything
with permutations between those analytical extremes.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> What about carnal desires?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I think those are powerful and probably potent in everyone; at
least everyone who is not asexual.  The need for food is unavoidable,
whereas sexual drives may be possible to contain, if the presence of
monks or hermits of all kinds of religions and persuasions is any
indication.  Regardless, my point is that we can work towards improving
those parts of our self beside the basic instincts that already are the
most developed.  Think of it like training: at first you can barely
perform the exercise but over time you get better at it.  Some may be
naturals in doing so, while others will have to put in more effort.  As
with the performance of professional athletes, not everyone can become
the same, but we can all try to improve ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> So if I start reading some books, I will expand my
intellectuality.  If I listen to music, attend theatres, watch movies,
visit a museum, pay attention to the architecture of buildings around
me, recite poetry, etc. I can refine my aesthetic self.  I get those can
be combined, so that, say, reading literature will have a benign effect
on both my aesthetic and intellectual dimensions.  I think those are all
clear, more or less.  Except the mystical one.  I have not heard about
it before.  Did you discover it in one of those books I assume you read
during the weekends?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> You should know by now not to assume much.  What better book
than the world itself?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> The world itself?  Do tell!</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> We work long hours.  On paper, we put in an eight-hour shift,
though we both know that is not true.  We start in the morning at half
past seven to eight, depending on the agenda, and we stay until seven in
the evening or later.  And we do this every weekday.  Add to that the
fact that we live in a city, each of us in an apartment that we retreat
to just to recharge our batteries for the morning after.  I go to bed
some time between nine or ten, meaning that I barely get any quality
time after work.  When Friday comes, I might stay up a bit longer, as I
am eager to get back to what I really want to do.  And this cycle
repeats every week and month.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I feel you.  What is mystical about that?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> At some point, you start feeling exhausted, mentally depleted.
You are not angry, just empty.  You can sense that you are losing touch.
It is not sadness per se, though you sense that simmering desperation
which pushes you to search for an exit, for an alternative.  Not knowing
what to do, you run a quick search online which eventually ends with you
boarding a train en route to the countryside.  You are not sure what to
expect on a Saturday morning, just that you need to move towards the
hinterland.  You arrive at the station and head straight to the nearby
forest.  What is even compelling you to behave in such a manner?  No one
knows for sure.  As you walk into the woods, you already sense a
different energy.  You can’t describe it quite yet, but you start to
feel relaxed.  It is quiet and you keep walking, having already marked a
spot to find your way back.  There is no pressure anymore.  You are
alone in the universe, or so you think.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Are you not afraid of wolves or generally of being on your own
in such a remote place?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Wolves are afraid of us after centuries of persecution and
habitat erosion.  The myth of the big bad wolf should be inverted to
refer to the rapacious human instead.  Same for sharks.  Humanity
slaughters them on an industrial scale, yet one shark attack gets
amplified as if we are the victims in the grand scheme of things.  But I
digress.  My account of the trip to the forest is just something for you
to relate to the mystical part of your being.  Back to my story and soon
everything will become clear.  You leave the forest feeling more
comfortable than before.  While you are puzzled at the chain of events
that led you to that place, you suspend your disbelief and go back home,
thinking about everything that transpired .  Your work continues to
exhaust you and you now have developed a habit of escaping to the trees.
After a few visits you start hearing sounds.  That place is not quiet as
you had initially thought.  It has a different rhythm.  You were used to
the frequencies of the boisterous city and were unable to pick up the
subtleties of the wilderness.  Now you are more attuned to them, to the
effect that the original impression of emptiness has been replaced by an
unmistakable feeling of ubiquitous presence.  What exactly is that which
is present you still cannot tell, but you are sure you are not alone any
more.  As you walk by a tree, you take note of an intriguing pattern.  A
large trunk with branches that reach high and wide conceals the sunlight
from some smaller trees in its midst.  How do those trees receive the
sunlight they need to grow?  You look around and are certain that they
cannot take it directly.  Yet they appear to be healthy.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I am curious to see where this is going…</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> You have already visited the place at various times during the
day and across the seasons.  Sunlight simply does not fall on those
young trees.  You look down and notice how they keep growing.  You turn
your attention upwards and take another close look at the towering tree
in front of you.  It has to be the parent tree and it must be
channelling a portion of its vitality to its children.  There is life
here; life of an advanced sort.  They are a family and behave just like
the families of mammals do, only at a different temporal frame and
within another spatial magnitude.  What for us is a year, for them is a
day or even less.  But we are alike in some important ways.  As you
connect the dots, you look around and identify the siblings of those
young trees and the society around them.  The forest is like a human
polity: all those complex relations give rise to emergent realities.  In
the human world, we have strictly intersubjective phenomena like
language as a magma of meanings or the inflation in the economy.  Those
cannot be reduced to the individual level.  The forest is the same.  It
is not just trees isolated from each.  They build bonds between them and
expand their network of communications.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> This is amazing!  I had no idea, though it sounds plausible.  So
what is the mystical experience?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> The realisation that life is all around you.  From the larger
beings to the smallest ones.  You can now find meaning in what was once
insignificant, unnoticeable even.  There are microorganisms everywhere
around us.  The space between me and you is filled with them.  They also
reside inside of us.  Our relationship with them is symbiotic.  Same
principle for the trees.  We would not be alive without the oxygen they
release.  And they would not be able to form their bonds without the
help of other symbiotes, the mycelial networks in between their roots.
We would not have this kind of planet if forests did not contribute to
the climate in the multitude of ways that they do.  And we can then
begin to apply that to everything.  You get the idea.  It changes the
way you see the world.  The forest is no longer a resource for us to
exploit.  A heap mass unprocessed lumber, as it were.  It is an
organism.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> So the mystical is the ability to connect with something that is
out there?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> In a sense, yes.  It helps you conceive of the bigger picture,
in which your ego is all but irrelevant.  To be clear, this is not about
forests as such.  I am just employing this as an example to show you how
you can escape from your default mindset of self-centred ignorance,
self-centred obsession.</p>

partiality</a>
(2021-03-14) ]</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I am impressed though I would need more time to internalise all
this and act on it.  I expected the conversation to go very differently,
but I am happy it turned out that way.  Though now I wonder what happens
when you stop being egocentric.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> It is not that you will get a notification on your computer or
anything that shows a clear point of divergence.  Those changes happen
gradually.  What takes place is a shift in perspective.  You gain the
ability to see things from another vantage point, a macroscopic level,
where phenomena can be interpreted very differently than at the
microscopic scale of your own person.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Can you offer an example?  The one with the forest did help.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Have you every played with dirt as a kid?</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Yes, I used to visit my grandparents during the summer.  They
lived in a village and I would run around the house, cautiously
exploring the great unknown that lay beyond.  It was within a radius of
a few meters from the house, but you get what I’m saying.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Good.  Sometimes while playing with dirt you spot a single ant.
It is out there searching for food.  If you toss it a breadcrumb, it
will pick it up and take it back to its colony.  If you throw a larger
piece of bread and wait for a while, you will notice more ants showing
up to carry the extra burden.  They collaborate to achieve the same
result, which is to collect food and bring it back home.  And if you
observe their patterns, you will realise how they seemingly all do the
same thing.  The term for that is “hive mind”, even though each ant can
act on its own, their concerted efforts lead to something that is
greater than themselves in isolation.  It is as if they are one larger
being.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I have heard about that before.  It is true for other insects as
well.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Indeed.  And I would argue that it applies to humans, despite
the obvious differences in complexity and scale.  Just look around you.
Cars are racing up and down the street.  People are passing by.  The
waiter comes and goes serving customers.  Some of them have just
arrived, others are leaving.  All this activity is but a tiny fraction
of what is going on in the city as a whole, and that is still
insignificant compared to the scale of operations at the regional level,
and then to the country at-large, and the entire continent, and the rest
of the globe.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Yes, that is clear.  Societies are contributing to some total
output that would be impossible at the level of the individual.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Not only in terms of sheer output, though.  I am claiming that
just as we can infer a collective consciousness that appears to be
governing the ants, we can think of the macro scale of human relations
as an emergent reality of its own.  Another type of consciousness which
connects the disparate and seemingly disorganised actions of individuals
into grand designs that reveal patterns which we could consider
efficient for the dissemination of information and for the joint quest
for survival.  From our micro perspective, this all sounds like a bunch
of absurdities.  Though we just need to refrain from our immediate,
individualistic reaction and think carefully about what is obvious in
every other aspect of life.  Obviously, I know we can talk about what is
wrong with our world in terms of politics and economics, though I am
trying to outline how an organism may be conceived as a system of
systems which may appear disconnected from each other when viewed from
any of its micro levels, but are in fact bound together when examined as
a whole.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Fair enough.  If I am getting this right, you are trying to
suggest that by opening up our selves to be more aware of aesthetics and
intellectuality and this mystical attribute, we can sort of understand
that we are the living cells of a greater organism.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Indeed.  And then you can draw the same inferences with regard
to every system within this planet and with the supersystem that
encompasses them, and then further with the still greater system that
holds them all together.  Not only are you better prepared to connect
with the world, but you become more sensitive to humans.  You can almost
see through them.  You can read them like an open book.  And you can
feel them and understand where they are coming from.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> In practical terms, you will stop judging people and refrain
from comparing and contrasting them to yourself.  Right?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> I will let you find that out on your own.  Next time you join
those coffee breaks, pay attention to how evaluations of other people
are made.  You are perceptive, after all.  I am sure you will figure
this out.  And then there is more to life where those insights can
apply.  Take it one step at a time.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Oh, the phone rings.  It is not a call.  Just a reminder that we
should be going soon.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Work, work, work.  Regardless, I must thank you for being so
kind and patient as to bear with me.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Meet you later?</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Yes, we have work to do.  Not afterwards though.  You still have
not given me enough information to determine whether your friend is
interesting.  And I do not know anything about you apart from our job
and today’s conversation.  Perhaps you are interesting!  Maybe I am
interesting.  Who knows?  I won’t try to entertain those notions, as I
still plan to visit those sites I alluded to earlier.  Nothing can
change my mind.  You should be able to guess what they may be, based on
everything I have shared thus far.  What matters though is that you
break the mould and seek to be treated as a fully fledged human being
and become a better version of who you are.  I think you can do it,
slowly yet steadily.  It is not about results, such as becoming more
intellectual than someone else.  There is no competition involved.  It
is the direction that is important, the overall shift in your attitude.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> I am happy that we shared those thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Likewise!  I seldom get the chance to do this.  Usually the
conversations are about the job’s trivialities.</p>

<p><strong>A.:</strong> Let’s go.</p>

<p><strong>B.:</strong> Bye.</p>

We are on a journey whose course we have not plotted.  Now you are here.
Tomorrow you may be long gone.  Everything is made easier to parse once
you accept impermanence.</p>
