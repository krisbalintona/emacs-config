         <p>In this video tutorial I present the <code>icomplete</code> library that is built
into Emacs.  This is an incremental completion framework that offers
live feedback on the candidates that match your current input.</p>

<p>I have been using Icomplete for a bit less than a month and have made
lots of customisations to it and other parts of the interface (such as
<code>display-buffer-alist</code>).  The result has proven good enough for me to
switch away from the Ivy completion framework (which I had also
configured quite extensively).</p>

<p>Icomplete is simple by design: take it as an opportunity to experiment
and to find your own solutions to problems that involve elisp scripting.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for the actual
implementation.</p>
