         <p>This video contains a concatenation of real-world simulations where I
employ keyboard macros and related commands to achieve the desired
results.  The idea is to do things efficiently, with the knowledge
that macros are an extremely powerful tool in Emacs.</p>

<p>The concepts implemented herein where first presented in my recent
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-07-29-emacs-kbd-macros/">Introduction to keyboard macros in
Emacs</a>.</p>
