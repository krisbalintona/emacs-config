         <p>In this video I showcase the Emacs front-end to the <code>notmuch</code> program.
Notmuch is a tool that indexes and searches through a local maildir
directory, while its Emacs interface is a powerful tool for handling
email correspondence, mailing lists, etc.</p>

<p>Notmuch only indexes and searches mail.  To actually fetch and send mail
you need other programs.  I document everything at length in my dotemacs
and I also share my exact configurations for all those tools:
