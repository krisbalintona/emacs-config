         <p>My highly-accessible themes for GNU Emacs have been admitted to the
MELPA repository.  The project is called “Modus themes” and it consists
of a light and a dark item.  The light theme is called “Modus Operandi”,
while the other is “Modus Vivendi”.</p>

<p>The Modus themes conform with the WCAG AAA standard for colour contrast.
This is the highest of its kind, which means that all interfaces should
be legible at all times.</p>

<p>Each theme is offered as a standalone package, as explained in the
video.  The easiest way to get them from MELPA is to run:</p>

<pre><code>M-x package-install RET modus-operandi-theme RET
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>M-x package-install RET modus-vivendi-theme RET
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can install them with <code>use-package</code> declarations,
such as:</p>

<pre><code>(use-package modus-operandi-theme
  :ensure t)

(use-package modus-vivendi-theme
  :ensure t)
</code></pre>

<p>As I mention in the video, the themes are under active development, even
though they already provide support for a comprehensive list of
packages.</p>

shots, and source code: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes</a>.</p>
