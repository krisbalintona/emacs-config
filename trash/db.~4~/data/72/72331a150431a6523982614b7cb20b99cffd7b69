         <p>In this screen cast I showcase my latest script, called “Git’s Eye
View”, else GEV.  This is a simple script I wrote for getting an
overview of the status of all git-controlled repositories inside a given
directory.</p>

<p>When running <code>gev</code>, a two-column list is drawn, with the status code on
the left and the file system path of the git-controlled repo on the
right.  The status codes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 == no changes</li>
  <li>1 == unstaged changes</li>
  <li>2 == staged, but not committed</li>
  <li>3 == untracked files</li>
</ul>

<p>GEV is part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.
Within the next month or so, I will publish a book on how to reproduce
my custom desktop session on Debian 10 Buster. An announcement will be
made in the <a href="https://protesilaos.com/news/">news section</a>.  The book will be available in the
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/books/">books section</a> under the same copyleft terms as all my work on
this website.</p>
