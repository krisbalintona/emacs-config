         <p>In this screen cast I announce the first stable release of my highly
accessible themes.</p>

<p>There are two items: a light and a dark.  Both conform with the
highest accessibility standard for colour contrast between foreground
and background values (WCAG AAA).  I call them the “Modus themes”:
<em>modus operandi</em> is the light theme, while <em>modus vivendi</em> is the dark
one.</p>

<p>The modus themes will continue to be developed until coverage of most
(if not all) faces is completed, including those defined by
third-party packages.</p>
