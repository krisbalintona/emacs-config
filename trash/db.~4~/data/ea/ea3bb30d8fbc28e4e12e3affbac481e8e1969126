         <p>In this video I provide an overview of my workflow with the built-in
Version Control (VC) framework of Emacs.  I am using it to manage all of
my Git projects.  VC has become my primary interface for Git even though
I keep Magit installed.  The latter is only needed for some specialised
operations—VC and my extras cover my day-to-day needs.</p>

<p>This demo includes lots of custom extensions that I have written in an
attempt to make VC work the way I want.  Refer to my Emacs configuration
file (“dotemacs”) for the implementation details:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.  The specific item that contains
those extensions is <code>prot-vc.el</code>.  Everything is part of my dotfiles’
repository: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles</a>.</p>
