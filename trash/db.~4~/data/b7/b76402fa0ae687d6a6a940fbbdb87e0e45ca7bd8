         <p>In this video I demonstrate a workflow for searching for files
recursively inside of a directory, using either a partial file name or
through the contents of a file.</p>

<p>My functions leverage two external programs: <code>fzf</code> and <code>rg</code> (or
<code>ripgrep</code>).  These are parsed through the Ivy completion framework and
its general Counsel front-end.  In addition, I show the power of custom
“Ivy actions” to dynamically change the scope of the search from file
names to contents and vice versa, or to just switch the root directory.</p>
