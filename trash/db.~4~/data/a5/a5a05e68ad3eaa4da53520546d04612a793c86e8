         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate how to use the power of the built-in
directory editor to create playlists of your media files.  Playlists are
curated file system paths that point to media files or directories that
contain such files.</p>

<p>You can play back the contents of playlists with Bongo.  When you insert
a playlist that contains links to directories, it will insert all media
files recursively.  Otherwise it just adds the music files that are
referenced.</p>

<p>As noted in the demo, here is my previous video on how I use <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-11-13-emacs-bongo-music/">Bongo with
Dired</a>
and here is my <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">dotemacs</a>, from where
you can get all my configurations for <code>bongo</code>, <code>dired</code>, etc.</p>
