<p>Do we always rationalise our condition or can an otherwise random
encounter engender an awareness about a hitherto unknown aspect of
ourselves which we may then reason about?</p>

<p>Now imagine.</p>

<p>It is winter time.  An evening like all others.  You leave the workplace
late as usual.  Must be 19:30 at minimum.  As you walk outside the
building, the rain gets stronger.  The weather forecast predicted as
much.  You button up and search your backpack in hope that you pull out
an umbrella.  Caught in your peripheral vision is a colleague who
exuberantly approaches your position.  Perhaps you are not the only
workaholic around or maybe there are no workaholics whatsoever and this
simply is the reality of those tacit job requirements…</p>

<p>— Don’t you have a car?</p>

<p>— No.</p>

<p>— Come, I’ll drop you wherever you want.  Where do you live?</p>

<p>Long work hours have taken their toll.  It shows.  You are not in the
mood to talk to anyone, make new friends, or even accept a kind offer
from a stranger.  Well, not a stranger per se, just one you have noticed
once or twice before without making their acquaintance.</p>

<p>— Don’t worry!  This is my favourite type of weather to go on foot.</p>

<p>— Strange…  You have no umbrella.  It is really bad.  Are you sure?</p>

<p>— Yes.</p>

<p>Off you go in a hurry.  Could you not even be bothered to utter a “bye”
or “good night”?  Words are so simple, yet situations make them
difficult.</p>

<p>Alone you are.  Half wet and feeling worn down.  Though you remain calm.
One might say “surprisingly so”.  You know better.  This minor
inconvenience is nothing compared to the ordeal of sociability that
comes at an inappropriate time.  While you understand the inner need to
recharge your batteries, the intuition of an appropriate time remains
elusive.  You have not found correspondence between that notion and your
quotidian experience.  When is the right moment and how does it feel
like?  Do you even want to meet people or are you only opening up to
those whom you trust?  And how can you entrust someone without getting
to know them?</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: you will be labelled a fool.  This is not about leaving
the umbrella at home and insisting on your preferred means of
transportation despite the unfavourable meteorological phenomena.  It
has to do with human relations.  Did you not see?  Why pass on a chance
to get to know a hot colleague?  It could be the start of something
fascinating.  And if not, it would not hurt taking your chances.  Sure,
everybody has a bad day or moments when they want to switch off.  But, I
mean…  Your reaction to that is to run?  Seriously?</p>

<p>Okay, that’s harsh and inconsiderate.  Apologies!  Normativity can do
that to the mind.  It makes it strip away the complexity from the case’s
actuality, reducing the actors to their simplified expected roles.
Expected by whom?  Who writes the script and who decides on the setting?
And why should any of that matter and under which circumstances?</p>

<p>No one can ponder such questions when they are tired.  Yet there you are
doing just that.  It has been hours since you last had the chance to
think; to wonder in quietude.  The walk back home is all you’ve got.
Not even the remote chance of an erotic escapade can take it from you.
How could it, after all?  You did not even turn your eyes to your side
and did not listen to your colleague’s opening statement:</p>

<p>— Hi!  I work in the office at the other end of the corridor.  I’ve seen
you before.  Nice to meet you!</p>

<p>— …</p>

<p>Did you not hear any of that or did you pretend not to listen to avoid
going down that path?  Sometimes you seem to pause and disconnect from
your surroundings while your mind is busy outlining some elaborate
conceptual apparatus.  That has to be it.  Nah, this is nonsense.  You
just assumed to be invisible and the remark was directed at someone
else.  It couldn’t possibly be you, after all.  No one would, right?
Behold the misguided internalisation of self-deprecation!  Or is it
unfettered honesty?</p>

<p>Invisibility is a superpower you can’t attain or a luxury you cannot
afford.  Either way you are conspicuous.  What you do and what you
don’t, when you speak and when you remain silent.  No matter the
particularities, you are always communicating a message that gets
interpreted by people in your milieu.  All you can do is endure their
scrutiny.</p>

<p>What does it mean to know someone?  And how can we be sure that our
knowledge is true?  There you are, walking in the rain thinking back at
the beginning of the end from a few months ago.  No, not the attractive
colleague from earlier.  You barely have recollection of that incident.
You did not even consider the attractiveness factor.  It did not
register with you as you were already caught between the surrounding
conditions and the world you were exploring in your mind.  Did that
dialogue even transpire?  Was it you participating in it or someone
behind you?  You cannot tell because you did not muster the strength to
turn your attention towards the person approaching you.  None of that
matters any more.  Only what stays with you can be problematic.  It is
hypocrisy that troubles you.</p>

<p>The beginning of the end… You had signed a new contract thinking that
you were just getting work done.  No fanfare, no boasting, no outward
sign of elation.  Nothing but a formality.  News travels fast though,
much to your chagrin.  Gossip, damned gossip!  As soon as you got back
to the office to resume your mundane task, a group of coworkers welcomed
you.  They brought gifts galore and alcohol to celebrate the occasion.
What’s so special about fizzy wine and the rest of the bunch?  The
bartender knows better after having prepared all those drinks a zillion
times.  Where did your peers draw all that apparent happiness from?  You
had barely ever talked with them and always were preoccupied with some
assignment whenever they tried to approach you.  There is no need to be
so industrious, by the way.  It is not like you will get bonus points
per unit of output.  The more efficient you are the more work you will
end up doing.  If you finish early, someone will simply invent a new
demand whose satisfaction is supposed to be bound by a hard deadline for
that same evening followed by an ominous “only if you want” remark.</p>

<p>While you were pondering about the precarity of living conditions that
led to the contractual agreement, you had to tend to the immediate issue
of the impromptu party.  Instead of joining them for a drink, you
thanked them halfheartedly and off you went to get some fresh air.  “Now
that I’m happy, I’m taking a 30 minute break”.  Such was your excuse.
Cheeky!  There went the party for you.  You didn’t care.  You never did.
Nor did they.</p>

<p>Something else had been haunting you.  There it was again.  Normativity,
the most prevalent of human conventions.  It always pushes you to behave
in a manner that is inconsistent with your current mood or your overall
disposition.  You had signed the contract shortly before going upstairs
to your office but the party served as the catalyst which made you
realise that no amount of money was ever going to be worth the pressure
to perform—it always is a performance above all else.  Such was no
spontaneous reaction.  You had considered it before and was hesitant to
sign the papers.  But you were not prepared to admit it.  There is a
trade-off between conformity with all its pleasures and comforts or an
uncertain life in pursuit of what may well be the chimera of
self-determination.  There are permutations between the extremes, though
you have long understood that in basic terms the latter has been your
destiny.  You always wanted to be yourself, else you had wished to
become that which you could not specify though understood intuitively.</p>

<p>To want something implies certainty in its presence.  Whence does this
certainty come from?  There are no facts of selfhood independent of the
conditions that produce them.  What you get is always framed,
influenced, or otherwise determined by its context.  Facts don’t speak
for themselves.  They do not have a standalone existence.  Even this
distinction between the presence and its environment is analytical.  You
won’t find it out there.  Your immediate milieu may consist, in a manner
of speaking, of other people which affect your perception of self.  Yet
while you are at the epicentre of this particular case, the same is true
for each of those persons individually in cases where everything appears
to revolve around them.  It is all a matter of perspective, about how we
choose to constitute the case.  Those who point at some datum without
assessing the underlying method used to derive it are either naive or
engaged in the business of deceiving you.  The method yields results
that act as positive reinforcement which feeds back into the discussion
on the given method, the methodology, from where comes a more refined
version of the original conceptual framework, and so on.  There is no
linearity, no terminus.  It follows a helix-like motion: it feels
circular yet never really covers the same points in its space.  The line
is not smooth either.  It is as if it is being drawn by the hand of an
infant.  Focus on the details and you will discern erratic zig-zag
motions at each turn.  Then again, this being a child means that it
cannot be pursuing a grand telos.  The helix is not inexorably
approaching its finality.  The kid makes mistakes, forgets what it was
pursuing by moving in that direction until it eventually shifts its
attention elsewhere.  Poof!  There goes your impression of unmitigated
progress.</p>

<p>You entertain the illusion of an objective truth in wanting to be your
self.  Who are you, anyway?  Is it the fellow who walks away instead of
rising to the occasion?  That cannot be it.  There must be something you
are running towards, something you are in pursuit of.  Or else there is
an underlying condition, some state of affairs, that makes you
comfortable.  It is what you associate with your true nature.  But why
only that?  When we are afraid, we flee; when we are confident, we stay
and remain firm.  Both are facets of our self.  To pick one is to
develop a narrative of self where you are depicted as the victim, the
misunderstood other, and in which you simultaneously idealise whatever
it is you are hiding.</p>

<p>There is no preconceived notion.  No certitude of that sort.  Yours is
not a claim on the objective’s substantive qualities.  You do not know
who you are.  It just is that you feel uncomfortable about certain
things and so you interpret those as being antithetical to your
disposition.  The truth you are arriving at is drawn negatively, by
ruling out what appears to be wrong.  If you were to sketch out at the
outset who your genuine self was and ventured to become that, you would
be assuming as truthful that which had not been verified.  Like those
people who buy a commodity they do not need, thinking that it will yield
them longer-term happiness, only to realise that it loses its appeal
very quickly.</p>

<p>You walk away.  Some may think you are pursuing your dreams.  Though you
are only escaping from what you dread.  Hypocrisy: the bane of your
existence.  Your ambition is to know yourself by getting to know others,
but those pesky role-playing tendencies keep getting in the way of your
plans and misplaced wants.  There is no one normativity.  What is
considered normal and what is enforced as such is specific to each
setting.  When people prepare you a surprise party, it is normal to be
filled with joy, feel appreciated, and indulge in boosting your egoism.
Despite all its evils, alcohol can help with cognitive dissonance and
can allow people who are trapped in etiquette to speak their mind.  The
bartender knows all about it.  There is always a normativity that
conditions behaviour.  It is not promulgated by some institution, it is
not written anywhere.  The society itself, the collective, perpetuates
its existence by reproducing the structures which support it.  People
come and go, while the culture we are confronted with remains.  All it
takes is to follow along.  Wear a mask to conceal your indifference and
become what you must.</p>

<p>Your trouble with selfhood stems from the uncertainty germane to the
concept of the negative truth, but also rests on the inherent
difficulties of decoupling persons from personas.  That cheerful
colleague of yours may be genuine or may be acting out to conform with
the norm.  A masked salesperson of happiness?  You let go of the
particulars.  They do not matter.  What you wrestle with are the
dynamics of the context, how the structure conditions the agents and how
those who exhibit the phenomenality of agency function as structure, as
the constants which enforce normativity when viewed from the perspective
of others.  There are no neat dichotomies, no “we against them”.  It is
not only you who faces difficulties in finding their true self.
Everyone does.  It cannot be that uncertainty has only gripped your
mind.  Those who behave in a certain way do so to relieve the pressure
of non-conformity.  It is their means of escape.  You are compelled to
operate the same way, only your threshold is different and are instead
pressured when you do acquiesce to what is done to you, namely, the
projection of expected patterns of behaviour upon your being.</p>

<p>How can the structure-agent dichotomy collapse into itself?  This is
your thought while the wind is howling and you keep getting wet.  You
really wanted to avoid that predicament back at the workplace.  The
absence of an umbrella would not deter you.  How far is your house,
anyway?  That car ride sure seems appealing right now, its driver
notwithstanding.  Then you recall how banalities ought not be
underestimated as they provide insight into the abstract order of
things.  What happened two weeks ago is a case in point.  You were asked
to join them for a drink on a Friday evening.  You politely declined.
Everyone was cool about it and expressed how they respect your choice
and only want you to preoccupy yourself with whatever works for you.
You took their sincerity at face value.  Faith is easier than doubt.  It
closes the circle.  Then, on the next occasion, they became passive
aggressive.</p>

<p>— Wanna join us?</p>

<p>— No, thanks.</p>

<p>— It’s fine that you do not like us.</p>

<p>— You got me wrong.</p>

<p>— Relax!  It’s a joke.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever laughed at that kind of humour?  At any rate, your
thoughts lie elsewhere.  We think of the structure as immutable and
impersonal, yet what we discern is other people, themselves agents.  The
structure consists of them plus their acquired behaviours.  It is the
set of patterns which we associate with roles that grants them
structurehood in that context.  Agency entails initiative.  Structure
delineates the realm of possibility within which action may unfold.
Agency can thus become structure when its functioning involves the
determination of possibilities, such as in how your peers mould you and
remake you cumulatively.  You think of this dynamic, of how it evolves
through its internal loops, and are prepared not to pass judgement on
others.  They are not necessarily hypocrites out of malicious intent.
Those are the rules.  Humanity can do anything when the game world
expects as much, including the capacity for inhumanity.  Why do you
think politicians, corporations and their consumers are fine with
extracting resources from war zones, exploiting foreign child labour,
destroying local ecosystems, and more?  Because the dictates of the game
are such where those magnitudes are not pertinent.  What matters is
year-on-year fiscal growth, or simply how many possessions you have at
your disposal.  Those determine your high score—and you can’t afford
to lose out on the leaderboard!</p>

<p>“It’s just a joke”.  Such an innocuous statement.  Much like the “it’s
just a job”.  There is no consideration of its underpinnings and its
consequences.  It is done because it has to.  And it needs to be carried
out by virtue of a shared delusion about the propriety of the narrative
that renders it placable.  The uneven distribution of power governing it
goes largely unnoticed.  The narrative is not a self-evident truth,
notwithstanding the pretences to the contrary.  It is what the powers
that be consider conducive to the preservation and eventual betterment
of their status.</p>

<p>You contemplate what made you think about those themes.  You walk away
because you are desperate to be heard.  Such a bizarre attitude, isn’t
it?  To search for a face in a world of masks.  You remain relaxed.
What compels you is not a decision of yours.  The pressure you feel in
those moments hints at an underlying reality.  You are repelled or
attracted by a given situation and your mind simply attaches feelings to
the respective reactions to reinforce the desired one until its
prioritisation requires the allocation of as few resources as possible.
There is nothing you can do about it.  People always tell you otherwise.
How you haven’t found the right one, that you should try harder, follow
some inane tips and tricks, take medication…  All so that you may
finally stop being maladjusted.  There it is: normativity in action.
You ought to do as much because the end goal, that of fitting in, is
assumed as a good in itself.  The game world does not consider the “why”
you perform those tasks.  Why should we grow?  Why must we buy more
stuff we don’t really need?  Who cares about their score on a
meaningless metric?  Questions of that sort cannot be raised.  They are
alien concepts.  What the game understands is the feedback it gets as a
result of the instructions it has passed on to you.  Do those and you
ascend in the leaderboard, which in your case is about making so-called
“friends” at the workplace who will not harass you any longer as you
will always be answering affirmatively, pursuing a successful career to
the effect that your bank account and the rubbish you accumulate expands
at the expense of your wellness, wanting to fuck someone—anyone—to
dispel any doubts while you are empty inside from the conditions imposed
upon your life.</p>

<p>None of that is the real “you”.  We assume normality to be a state where
behavioural patterns are not conditioned by what effectively are thinly
disguised orders backed by implicit threats.  There’s the uncertainty
once again: one cannot pinpoint this brand of normality in positive
terms, but only as the absence of compulsion.</p>

<p>A realisation springs to mind.  You did not always walk away.  It
started happening at some point, but you are sure it was not the case
from the beginning.  So if your perception of self is to be influenced
by your current state, then your prior state would have to inform the
impression of your self at that time.  There is change.  How can you be
your self, let alone your true self, when that which you aspire towards
is not constant?  Its phenomenality presents it as a variable.  Is
variability open-ended or otherwise characterised by randomness?  Can,
in other words, the variable assume any possible value or only a narrow
set of predetermined ones?  If the former, then your quest is in vain,
for what you want is but a fleeting dream.  There is the recognition of
variability, which raises the expectation that it might persist as
variability—itself a constant.  And there is the belief that the value
it may acquire is arbitrary.  As such, the self is indeterminable.  What
must then be the conclusion if the possible values the variable may take
are limited to a small set?  It means that the self is a composite which
consists of both constant and variable parts.</p>

<p>The notion of a composited self seems more plausible to you.  It helps
you hypothesise about why some people gravitate towards wearing certain
masks instead of others.  You can predict the role they will likely
assume under different scenaria.  It also lets you discern patterns amid
the multitude of phenomena with which to infer an abstract edifice.  No
two rain drops are the same, yet you know what happens when you walk in
the rain, you are certain that water will fall from the clouds, and so
on.  The process of change does not render meaningless the underlying
substance so long as you are clear that the thinkable is distinct from
the instantiable.  The conflation between process and substance, the
belief that only one of the two is real is reinforced by the failure to
admit the possibility that what is thought to be the case is not
necessarily the case and that what may ever be thought to be the case is
all that the case may ever appear to be.</p>

<p>We cannot act from a position of certainty, as our scepticism will force
us into stasis.  How did we arrive at that certitude?  Is it the truth,
in the sense of us having passed final judgement on it?  Or is it an
intermediate point between research programmes?  If the former, did we
expand that certitude to the adequacy of the instruments that were used
to deliver those findings and so on recursively?  Be honest!  If,
instead, our certainty is couched in terms of an ongoing inquiry, we can
accept it as an expedient workaround, provided we make a sincere effort
to hold as few assumptions as we can.  Ad-hoc faith keeps us going.  No,
not dogmatism, not unflinching belief in something decisively
unverifiable.  It is about heuristics and hypotheses which are
formulated and tested in a spirit of non-commitment.  It is paradoxical
that scepticism presupposes certainty of an intermediate sort.  The key
to resolving the apparent contradiction is in the disposition of not
clinging on to said findings.  What matters is the attitude of
approximating the truth, not the misplaced reaction to stand behind
one’s pet project.</p>

<p>To try to remain truthful to one’s self is to experiment with a
hypothesis at any given point.  We flee situations that are stressful to
us on the premise that we will find a better place somewhere else.  What
if it does not exist or we can’t get there?  Hope is good, provided it
is reasonable.  Otherwise it can blur the lines between the real and the
imaginary.  The astute student of events acknowledges that there is no
point in escaping the inescapable.  What must follow is acceptance, not
dread.  To recognise how things stand instead of entertaining illusions.
We are calm only insofar as we are aligned with reality.  Everything
else is to our detriment.</p>

<p>As you reach the apartment, you inquire upon the desirability of a walk
that happens regardless of the prevailing conditions.  It is the only
time when you do not sense norms besieging you while in public.  Those
are the moments during which you are allowed to think.  There may be
people all around you.  It does not matter.  You have taken measures to
protect yourself.  They cannot form the structure that informs your
agency.  Not in this case.  They are no friends, colleagues, relatives
in the sense that there is no relationship of control in effect.  The
parameters of the bond are what matters, not the actual persons
involved.  Individuals do not wield power.  Status does.  To walk alone
and maintain a low profile is to be as free as possible from claims on
your conduct.  As for the rain, you actually enjoy it for it ensures
that no one will join you.  No point in taking chances with losing such
precious moments, correct?</p>

<p>Have you rationalised your insecurities and assumed them to be your pure
self?  Did you think of them as inevitable and unalterable?  Have you
befriended your fear in the hope of turning it into its opposite?  It is
always busy inside that head of yours…  You answer one question, ten
more emerge.  It never ends, though you know that already.  Hence your
aloofness.  You take a cold shower.  It feels good, despite the initial
shock.  Why would you even do that in February?  Have you not suffered
enough?  Or is that minor inconvenience ephemeral and thus tolerable,
since it is not attached to some criterion of persistent conditionality?
As you are about to go to bed, you decide on your future.  That contract
shall not be renewed.  There will be more walks, but there will not be
any more walking away from what underlies those events.  You recognise
that your self remains to be determined.  As you close your eyes you
prepare to take a leap of faith into the unknown.</p>
