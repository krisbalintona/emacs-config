         <p>In this screen cast I present some of the more advanced or perhaps
less obvious ways of using Emacs’ built-in search tool. <code>isearch</code> is
quite a competent tool that can be made even better with some careful
additions of elisp.</p>

<p>Based on what I know right now, there is a niche for both <code>isearch</code>
and <code>swiper</code>, even though the latter is often used a replacement for
the former.</p>

<p>All my customisations are defined in my “dotemacs” file—now provided
as a dedicated page inside this website (with links to its source):
