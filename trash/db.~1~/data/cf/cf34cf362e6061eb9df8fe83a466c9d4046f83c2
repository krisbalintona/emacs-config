         <p>In this video I offer an introduction to <code>rg.el</code>, an interface to the
<code>ripgrep</code> command line tool.  I like this package because it remains
faithful to the interface paradigms that are implemented by similar
tools inside of Emacs, such as the built-in <code>grep</code> or <code>occur</code>.  I also
appreciate the fact that it interfaces with <code>ibuffer</code>, another built-in
library.</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for configurations
on <code>rg.el</code> and more.</p>
