         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate the power of Emacs’ <code>occur</code>
function using a real-world scenario.</p>

<p>On the face of it, <code>occur</code> is similar to <code>grep</code>: it outputs a list of
results matching a search pattern.  However, these results can be
interfaced with and can even be edited directly, with all changes
echoed to the actual file.</p>

<p>As such, <code>occur</code> can be used as a “scoping” or “narrowing” tool to
limit the buffer to certain terms.  Then the full editing capabilities
of Emacs can be put to use: replacing using regular expressions,
keyboard macros, external packages such as <code>multiple-cursors</code>, etc.</p>

<p>I can already state with confidence that Emacs is a powerhouse of
productivity once you familiarise yourself with its tools and
utilities.</p>
