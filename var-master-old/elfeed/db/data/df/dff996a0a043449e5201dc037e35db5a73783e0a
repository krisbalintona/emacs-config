<strong>Update 2021-01-27 13:55 +0200:</strong> Tweaked Org regexp to avoid bold text at
the beginning of the line.<br />
<strong>Update 2021-01-27 16:39 +0200:</strong> Added Annex.</p>

<p>Today I learnt how to instruct <code>git</code> to read the syntactically relevant
beginning of the given context when producing diff hunk headings.  My
intent is to improve the output for Emacs Lisp and Org mode files.</p>

<p>The diff hunk heading is the text that is appended to the lines of a
given change.  You must have noticed those:</p>

<p>By default, the text for Elisp buffers is not particularly informative.

<p>The heading <code>with the specified date."</code> does not really enlighten us as
to what function is touched by this change.  Whereas with my newfound
knowledge I get this:</p>

<p>The <code>(defun prot-simple-inset-date (&amp;optional arg)</code> is insightful as it
lets us understand in more precise terms the context of the relevant
change.</p>

<p>Same principle for Org, where it will read the heading under which the
diff occurs:</p>

<p>Got the correct heading: <code>*** Version control framework (vc.el and

<h2>Git config and attributes files</h2>

<p>To get things to work we need to create <code>~/.config/git/attributes</code> and
add at least the following:</p>

<pre><code>*.lisp  diff=lisp
*.el    diff=lisp
*.org   diff=org
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in <code>~/.config/git/config</code> append:</p>

<pre><code>[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\(.*)$"
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
</code></pre>

<p>And you should be good to go.</p>

<p>This is based on information I got from the manpages.  The first version
of the regular expressions comes from this page:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ruediger/5647207">https://gist.github.com/ruediger/5647207</a>.</p>

<p>My Git config:</p>

<pre><code>[user]
  name = Protesilaos Stavrou
  email = info@protesilaos.com
  signingkey = 99BD6459CD5CA3EA
[core]
  excludesfile = ~/.config/git/ignore
  attributesfile = ~/.config/git/attributes
[commit]
  gpgsign = true
[merge]
  conflictstyle = diff3
[pull]
  rebase = false
[format]
  thread = true
[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\(.*)$"
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
</code></pre>

<h2>Quality-of-life improvements</h2>

<p>I am very happy with this otherwise minor tweak and am looking forward
to learn more about optimising my computing environment.  Git, in
particular, is a powerful and comprehensive suite of tools that has a
lot to offer.  I have been reading through its manpages now that I am
not a total novice (with either <code>M-x man</code> or <code>M-x woman</code>) and am
discovering new information that can, among others, benefit my Emacs
setup.</p>

<p>My git-related configurations are part of my dotfiles.  That is where I
also keep all my Emacs files: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>If some Emacs power user knows how to improve upon this setup, please do
contact me: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex</h2>

<p>Gustavo Barros contacted me to share another take on the Elisp regexp.
I am sharing it with permission.  This matches <code>outline-minor-mode</code>
comment headings, any top-level form at beginning of line, and some
selected forms even when indented:</p>

<pre><code>[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(((;;;+ )|\\(|([ \t]+\\(((cl-|el-patch-)?def(un|var|macro|method|custom)|gb/))).*)$"
</code></pre>

<p>I like the idea and am excited to see what else we can do with this and
other “hidden gems” of Git.</p>
