         <p>In this video I demonstrate some of the powers of <code>isearch</code> through a
keyboard macro.  This explains why I still rely on this unassuming yet
potent built-in tool while I also have a package declaration for
<code>swiper</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> for the
documentation and package declarations I provide.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, Swiper is a search tool underpinned by
the Ivy completion framework that I use: it fills a different niche
than that of Isearch.</p>
