         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate the minor tweaks I have made to Emacs’
various transposition commands.  Their combined effect contributes to a
more efficient workflow.</p>

<p>“Transpose” in this case, means to exchange the positions of two text
objects.  This applies to words, sentences, lines, paragraphs, symbolic
expressions (sexps).</p>
