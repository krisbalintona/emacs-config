         <p>Elfeed is a third-party standalone feed reader (RSS/Atom) for Emacs.  It
ships with good defaults and is well designed overall.</p>

<p>In this video I describe the main principles of Elfeedâ€™s interaction
model, specifically its expressive and efficient tagging system.  I also
demonstrate the custom extensions I have written for it, which leverage
other parts of the Emacs ecosystem.</p>
