         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate the basics of BSPWM (Binary Space
Partitioning Window Manager).  This is a tiling window manager that
I use on my Debian GNU/Linux machine.  It is an integral part of my
custom desktop session.</p>

<p>For the underlying code base, refer to <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my
dotfiles</a>.  The more
adventurous among you can also have a look at an older article of mine
on <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/how-to-bspwm-debian-sid/">how to get my setup on Debian
Sid</a> (though this will not give you
the most up-to-date version of my dotfilesâ€”I intend to have a new guide
in time for Debian 10).</p>
