         <p>This screen cast is a demonstration of my shell script that implements
dynamic desktop creation/removal in the Binary Space Partitioning Window
Manager.  It is a feature that runs contrary to the upstream default of
setting a fixed number of desktops.</p>

<p>This script and all other parts of the demo are distributed with <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my
dotfiles</a>.</p>
