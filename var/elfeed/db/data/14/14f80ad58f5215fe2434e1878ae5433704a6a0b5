         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate my methodology for writing tasks, as
well as a couple of scripts for interacting with the to-do list.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>stm</code> is a CLI tool that provides various ways of presenting the
pending tasks, using standard UNIX utilities.</li>
  <li><code>stmmenu</code> is a <code>dmenu</code> interface that either removes a matching string
from the list, or appends a non-matching item to the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>All scripts as well as the entire desktop session are part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my
dotfiles</a>.</p>
