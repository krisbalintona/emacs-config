         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate three scripts I have developed for
setting my custom desktop sessionâ€™s wallpaper.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sbg</code> is a CLI tool that accepts the path to a single image file as an
argument.  All it does is set that file as the new wallpaper.</li>
  <li><code>sbgmenu</code> is a <code>dmenu</code> interface with two modes: (i) viewing images,
(ii) setting a wallpaper.  Everything is still text-based.</li>
  <li><code>nbm</code> follows a graphical approach.  It presents an image grid where
the user can enlarge an image and mark the one intended as the new
wallpaper.</li>
</ul>

<p>All scripts as well as the entire desktop session are part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my
dotfiles</a>.</p>
