         <p>In this screen cast I offer my opinion on some of the common debates
in the free software space about which is the best text editor, tiling
window manager, desktop environment, etc.</p>

<p>My approach is to consider the context: the user and their needs.
There is a tool for every person and every niche.  What we should
always keep in mind is the spirit of free software: sharing the
knowledge and, thus, being altruistic.  We do not want elitism.</p>
