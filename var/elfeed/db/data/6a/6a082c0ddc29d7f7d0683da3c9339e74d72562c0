<p>1 Scepticism is a disposition towards knowledge and learning.</p>

<p>1.1 The sceptic asks for sufficient proof before providing assent to a
certain claim or judgement about how things stand.</p>

<p>1.2 The method has to be rigorous and precise to eliminate any dogmatic
tendencies. It must remain open to the possibility of further revisions.</p>

<p>1.2.1 Dogma is the staunch refusal to reconsider the given opinion. It
also is the adoption of a firm view about things in the absence of
sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>1.3 An open method is characterised by dubitativeness and
inquisitiveness. Its objective is the attainment of <em>episteme</em>, or else
objective knowledge.</p>

<p>1.3.1 Episteme is certainty about a fact. It should be distinguished
from “knowledge” in the familiar sense. That typically denotes
“familiarity with” or “intimate understanding of” a certain case, even
if that is not necessarily objective. For instance, one may know what
the story of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is. That does not constitute
episteme.</p>

<p>1.4 Objective knowledge must be accessible by anyone using established,
imitable methods. The results must not rely on subjective evaluations,
revelations, or any kind of intuition that is not reproducible and
independently verifiable.</p>

<p>1.4.1 Mysticism or occultism cannot fall in that description, for their
premise is that one needs to be an insider before understanding the
inner truth or hidden meanings of their teachings. Again, that would be
a case of knowing about them, but of not having episteme.</p>

<p>1.5 The sceptic’s method is inherently dialectical. For being
inquisitive <em>and</em> dubitative implies a certain eagerness to engage with
counter arguments in pursuit of refining the method as well as improving
any results it may yield.</p>

<p>1.5.1 Dialectic is not equivalent to dialogue. The latter is an exchange
of views. Whereas the former constitutes a collaborative attempt at
attaining episteme. Those engaging in dialectic do not do so out of an
interest to persuade the other side about the correctness of their
views. Rather, they put forward propositions in an attempt to evaluate
their validity. For the dialectician, “losing the argument” is actually
a win. They have been liberated from a certain falsehood.</p>

<p>2 Science is a sceptical field of endeavour. Its task is to gather
evidence in support of a certain hypothesis about how things
stand. Verified hypotheses form broader theories, which themselves can
describe states of affairs in objective terms.</p>

<p>2.1 The scientist hypothesises and then verifies or reconsiders based on
criteria of necessity, sufficiency, and propriety.</p>

<p>2.2 The scientist qua scientist can only become dogmatic if they lose
their self awareness with regard to the role of science.</p>

<p>2.2.1 When a certain scientist expresses an opinion based on
insufficient evidence or speculative assumptions, any fault does not lie
with science, but only with the scientist.</p>

<p>2.3 The scientist’s scepticism is contingent on their commitment to the
modes of scepticism. An understanding of what may lead one to suspend
ultimate judgement and continue further research instead.</p>

<p>3 Scepticism is concerned with removing prejudice from the method of
inquiry. The sceptic does not deny a given truth for the sake of
denying. Rather they engage with the [pro]position in an effort to
evaluate its necessity, sufficiency, and propriety for the case under
examination.</p>

<p>3.1 Progress in science and/or applied methods is achieved by [tacitly]
holding that the given state of knowledge can be broadened or further
refined. While this may be dismissed as a pedantic exercise, it is
necessary for expanding one’s understanding of things.</p>

<p>3.2 Without scepticism, even in cases where it is implicit, there would
come a point of saturation and stagnation. The claim of not needing to
research something that is already known can become dogmatic if it
hampers efforts at trying new approaches at attaining episteme. That is
even more so for claims about things that remain open to interpretation
and are, therefore, subject to contradiction.</p>

<p>3.3 Scepticism is the prerequisite to pragmatism. The latter is the
disposition of understanding things as they are, for what they
are—pragmata. That implies having to deal with objective magnitudes that
cannot be moulded into one’s own world view. Any hypothesis, theory, or
ultimate claim is derived from engagement with <em>pragmata</em>.</p>

<p>3.4 The sceptic cannot create a perfect and complete model that explains
everything in advance. Such idealism would presume certainty about the
fundamentals of knowledge and learning. It would also postulate a system
of thought that is essentially closed; a finished article.</p>

<p>3.4.1 The sceptic’s starting point is to examine whether there are
reasons to maintain a certain [pro]position open to further
refinements. That involves inquiry into the various factors of the case
to assess the completeness of the argument at hand.</p>

<p>3.5 Based on continuous research, the sceptic arrives at the abstract
structure of their arguments in favour of withholding ultimate judgement
and continuing with inquiry. Such abstract structure is the
philosophical foundation of scepticism, which consists of a series of
arguments about the reasons pointing to the need for remaining
inquisitive, dubitative, and dialectical.</p>

<p>3.6 The arguments for scepticism can be referred to as “modes”,
“tropes”, “positions”, or any other term that denotes a certain stance
towards things and a way of approaching a research programme. According
to Sextus Empiricus,<sup id="fnref:OutlinesPyrrhonism" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:OutlinesPyrrhonism" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the ten modes of scepticism as
formulated by Aenesidimus of Knossos are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That are these: the first, based on the variety of animals; the
second, on the differences in human beings; the third, on the
different structures of the organs of sense; the fourth, on the
circumstantial conditions; the fifth, on positions and intervals and
locations; the sixth, on intermixtures; the seventh, on the quantities
and formations of the underlying objects; the eight, on the fact of
relativity; the ninth, on the frequency or rarity of occurrence; the
tenth, on the disciplines and customs and laws, the legendary beliefs
and the dogmatic convictions. This order, however, we adopt without
prejudice.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As superordinate to these there stand three modes—based on the subject
who judges, that on the object judged, and that based on both. (p.27)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4 Where the ten modes fall short is on failing to ground scepticism
beyond the empirical domain. All ten modes are essentially a way of
suggesting that the world is in flux, including us as observers, and
therefore we cannot know for certain what the constants are.</p>

<p>4.1 A firm commitment to the ten modes must rule out the possibility of
<em>identity</em>. We cannot tell whether some change occurs if we do not have
an idea of what the opposite of change is.</p>

<p>4.2 It seems pointless to argue that everything changes and then hold
that this very argument remains constant. A sceptic can consistently
identify with their own views, which points to the constancy of
<em>something</em>.</p>

<p>4.3 If something defies the general rule, the task of the sceptic is to
examine whether it is the exception or the rule that is flawed. The
latter has to be the case where there is a multitude of exceptions with
differences in degree and category between them. On such occasions, the
rule has to be dismissed as inadequate.</p>

<p>4.4 The ten modes do not capture objects of thought, ideas. These do not
only concern ideas about the world, such as abstractions of patterns,
but also ideas about ideas, or else orders of abstraction and the
structure thereof.</p>

<p>4.4.1 Take, for example, the argument for the differences in human
beings. While there is proof that no two humans exhibit the exact same
DNA structures, we can still trace patterns among humans—commonalities
in the multitude of instantiations—to arrive at an understanding of what
a “human being” generally is. The notion of a “human being” is an
abstraction from things themselves, yet very much consistent with
them. It is an object of thought that renders possible the very claim
that there are differences between humans. A constant against which one
may observe differentiations.</p>

<p>4.4.2 To propound arguments for difference one must be in a position to
discern constants that distinguish one entity from another, one state of
being from another, and so on. Furthermore, one must be able to grasp
differences of degree and category, such as two apples having a slightly
different taste, or an apple and a human differing in fundamental ways.</p>

<p>4.5 Whether it is a matter of degree or category, difference as such
remains constant. It is never conflated with likeness, just as a
constant is not mistaken for a variable. Again, this points at the
presence of a certain benchmark against which objective claims may be
propounded. It suggests that objects of thought can remain immutable,
especially towards themselves. Absolute relativity is self
contradicting.</p>

<p>5 A reformulation of Aenesidimus’ theory would have to ground scepticism
on three separate grounds: (1) empirical, (2) epistemological, (3)
metaphysical. The original theory fails to account for the distinction
between objects of sense and thought. It does not provide sufficient
scope for critically examining instantiations and abstractions with a
high degree of complexity.</p>

<p>5.1 Starting with the empirical domain, the ten modes can be
reformulated as one: <strong>the mode of instantiation</strong>. This pertains to how
instances of an abstraction are identified in the world, both relative
to the form they extend, and in juxtaposition or relation to other
presences.</p>

<p>5.1.1 An instance is a presence that partakes of the qualities of a
higher order abstraction. An instance extends the abstract in the sense
that in addition to the common qualities, it substantiates specific ones
that distinguish it both from the abstraction as well as other
instances.</p>

<p>5.1.2 An example is in order. The breeds <code>German Shepherd</code>, <code>Labrador
Retriever</code>, and <code>Rottweiler</code> are extensions of the more abstract
presence of <code>dog</code>. Each is a subset of the latter. Yet each subset is
itself an object of thought. The idea of a breed is a generalisation
based on patterns identified in individual specimens. All breeds are the
same animal by virtue of sharing the same generic qualities of
<code>dog</code>. All breeds differ from each other due to the fact that each
extends <code>dog</code> in different ways. Moreover, each individual dog that
belongs to a certain breed will still exhibit unique characteristics
that render it unique among the multitude of dogs of the same breed.</p>

<p>5.1.3 The same holds in the transition from a superordinate to a
subordinate order of abstraction, from the more general to the more
specific. The mode of instantiation applies throughout.</p>

<p>5.2 Even though we refer to orders of abstraction, the domain remains
the empirical. The way one can arrive at a general concept is by
observing patterns. Patterns are immanent to things. If items <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>,
<code>C</code> each exhibit, among others, features <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, then it follows
that the array <code>x, y, z</code> is a commonality of theirs. The commonality can
thus be considered superordinate to <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and described in its
own terms as containing the array <code>x, y, z</code>. Properties unique to each
instance are to be treated as the factors of differentiation between the
instances; the qualities that render them unique. The following
formalisation describes as much:</p>

<pre><code>A [a, b, x, y, z]
B [c, d, x, y, z]
C [e, f, x, y, z]

foo [x, y, z]

foo
    A [a, b]
    B [c, d]
    C [e, f]
</code></pre>

<p>5.3 The mode of instantiation encompasses the ten modes of Aenesidimus
while enriching them with a bifurcated understanding of objects of sense
and of thought as distinct from each other. Indeed, this distinction is
a prerequisite to rescuing the ten modes from self
contradiction. Without accounting for objects of thought, it is
impossible to have a full understanding of our grasp of the objective
world, such as through the observation of patterns, the construction of
orders of abstraction, and the presence of identities therein.</p>

<p>6 Episteme derives from direct experience with the world in accordance
with a method that guarantees the objectivity of results in a
necessarily predictable fashion. The method must provide for the
adequacy of findings in describing a certain phenomenon and in capturing
its full extent. There is, nonetheless, a third criterion, which is the
<em>propriety</em> of the method as such: whether the research programme is
designed to reveal the objective truth rather than obfuscate it.</p>

<p>6.1 The problématique about method introduces us to the second mode of
scepticism: <strong>the mode of contextualisation</strong>. It refers to the
specificity of facts in relation to the state of affairs in which they
are made manifest.</p>

<p>6.2 Experience with the world does not happen in a vacuum. Whatever is
being researched exists in a context, in a certain set of relations with
its environing whole. Its own phenomenality is as much contingent on its
inner workings as well as any exogenous forces that apply to it.</p>

<p>6.2.1 Human behaviour can serve as an argument in point. A research
programme can focus on the actions of agents and patients, examining
them as such. Whatever findings are valid insofar as they describe the
actions in a narrow sense. For a more holistic analysis, the programme
must encompass other magnitudes, such as the social and cultural
backgrounds of the situational agents/patients, the historical,
economic, or political triggers to their actions, as well as the
biological, neurological, or other forces pertaining to [human] nature
that anyhow frame or otherwise determine the behaviour. In the absence
of such contextualisation, the research programme can only offer an
account of a decontextualised, largely simplified, version of the
phenomena; one that is likely to be incomplete or even misleading,
especially if generalisations are drawn therefrom.</p>

<p>6.3 Contextualisation in conjunction with an understanding of the
abstract structure (orders of abstraction and the structure thereof) is
a prerequisite to identifying phenomena of an emergent sort; phenomena
that are only realisable under certain sets of relations between the
facts of the case.</p>

<p>6.4 A holistic research programme applies the mode of contextualisation
in an effort to appreciate the <em>constitution of the case</em> at hand. To
find the immediate as well as emergent factors contributing to the
unfolding phenomena. That would begin to satisfy the method’s criterion
of propriety.</p>

<p>7 The abstract structure reveals a metaphysical domain for grounding
scepticism. Each order is distinct from its sub- or super- ordinates in
terms of the qualities germane to it. What applies to a certain order of
abstraction may not hold true for others.</p>

<p>7.1 The difference between a form and its instances is one of category
or substance. The former cannot be reduced to the latter while remaining
constant. Drawing from the previous formalisation, <code>foo [x, y, z]</code>
cannot become the same as <code>A [a, b, x, y, z]</code> for that would entail
attaining new properties, namely, the array <code>a, b</code>.</p>

<p>7.1.1 What holds true for an instance will not apply in fullness to its
form or to other instances of the same form. Each instance qua instance
exists as a unique extension of the abstraction, where its qualities are
not shared by the higher order. If the qualities where found in the
form, then these would also have to be shared among the other instances,
which would render impossible the distinction between the instances and
the form.</p>

<p>7.2 The presence of orders of abstraction suggests that a system of
forms and instances will consist of a multitude of levels with rules
that are of a general or universal sort as well as rules or
characteristics that are local or even unique to certain instances.</p>

<p>7.2.1 Recall the aforementioned formalisation:</p>

<pre><code>A [a, b, x, y, z]
B [c, d, x, y, z]
C [e, f, x, y, z]

foo [x, y, z]

foo
    A [a, b]
    B [c, d]
    C [e, f]
</code></pre>

<p>The instances <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> are distinct from each other because each
has certain unique properties. Yet they are similar enough to qualify as
extensions of a form <code>foo</code>. We see that <code>foo</code> does not encompass the
factors of differentiation among its instances. It does not have the
qualities <code>a, b, c, d, e, f</code> for these are not common among the
instances. It can only be considered as having the commonalities among
the multitude. Otherwise, the distinction between the form and the
instances would be false, for <code>foo</code> would be yet another instance,
albeit with more qualities than the others. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>A [a, b, x, y, z]
B [c, d, x, y, z]
C [e, f, x, y, z]
foo [a, b, c, d, e, f, x, y, z]

baz [x, y, z]

baz
    A [a, b]
    B [c, d]
    C [e, f]
    foo [a, b, c, d, e, f]
</code></pre>

<p>7.2.2 What is true for a two level structure holds for a multitude of
levels. The inference to be drawn is that what is known for one must be
explicitly documented as such. Inquiry into the specifics or the broader
magnitudes might reveal aspects of the truth that were obscured from
that method.</p>

<p>7.3 With such metaphysics we arrive at <strong>the mode of application</strong>. It
concerns the validity of [pro]positions based on their scope relevant to
the abstract structure of what is being studied.</p>

<p>7.3.1 The mode of application is, among others, a pragmatic
counter-argument to the <em>regress ad infinitum</em> thesis. It does not
matter that something derives, suggests, or otherwise relates to
something else, which itself hints at another relation and so on in
perpetuity. Only in the theoretical case of acquiring absolute certainty
would one need to wrestle with infinite regress. In practice, what we
are dealing with are orders of abstraction from immediate sense
impression to formal thought about it, and then from abstraction and
modelling to the formulation of general rules about objectivity.</p>

<p>7.3.2 It does not matter if, say, cause and effect regress
infinitely. If pushing an object with enough force always sets it in
motion under the right circumstances, one can be certain that <em>for that
very level</em> or in that very constitution of the case, the cause and the
effect are identifiable.</p>

<p>8 The mode of application is the most abstract of the three modes of
scepticism suggested herein. It provides the metaphysical underpinnings
to an epistemology that contextualises and treats in its fullness a
certain case. The two support the empirical case for remaining sceptical
about the specifics—the very instantiation—of what is being studied.</p>

<p>9 Scepticism is a pragmatic and holistic disposition towards knowledge
and learning.</p>
