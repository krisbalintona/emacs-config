<p>Dialectic is an inter-personal experience: a rigorous dialogical process
where parties to an argument exchange views in pursuit of the common
objective of approximating the truth.  Socrates used the dialectical
method in this exact way: a certain kind of targeted conversation.</p>

<p>To effectively and consistently partake in dialectic, one must have
developed several virtues.</p>

<p>They must be honest.  To stand by their arguments, recognise any
possible mistake of theirs, not misrepresent the other side’s positions,
not employ rhetorical tricks, not assume malevolence in the opposing
side’s propositions or act in bad faith, and the like.</p>

<p>Honesty ultimately results in a style of communication that is plain and
unambiguous, or at least tries to be as straightforward as possible,
given the sometimes difficult or nuanced concepts of philosophy.  This
can be presented outright or upon the request of the other party to the
dialogue, in the sense of answering questions along the lines of “what
do you mean by X?”.  One does not try to use tenuous metaphors, rely on
paradoxical claims, make exaggerations, seek to impress, assign peculiar
significations to words without sufficiently explaining them, etc.  And
one must be cooperative and willing to clarify any statement of theirs.</p>

<p>Honesty and plain-spoken-ness contribute to a special type of courage.
One where the person is not afraid to maintain their presence in front
of the other side to the dialogue and/or whatever audience.  The Greek
word for this is <em>parrhesia</em>.  Parrhesia is revealed when one proceeds
to formulate their position because they think it better approximates
the truth and does so no matter the social-political benefits or costs.</p>

<p>What happens if we cannot arrive at a satisfactory conclusion through
our dialogue, no matter how hard we try?  Do we just claim that whatever
findings of ours are the best approximation of the truth that can ever
be attained?  That would be dishonest, for we would be rationalising our
shortcomings as extra-personal constants.  Instead, we ought to
acknowledge that more work needs to be done.  Furthermore, once we do
have a satisfactory outcome, do we purport to know what the truth is and
be unequivocal in our commitment to it?  Is our evaluation of what
counts as “satisfactory” or “done” an ultimate value judgement?  The
answer is negative.  Parrhesia requires us to be bold in how honest we
are towards others and ourselves.  In this case, it underpins an
<em>aporetic</em> (dubitative) disposition.  One is prepared to recognise the
constraints they find themselves in, to admit that “I do not know”, “I
may be wrong”, “the factors that informed my judgement may have been
inadequate, my data incomplete, and/or my capacities limited”, “the
outcome is a function of inputs that may be refined upon further
investigation”, and so on.</p>

<p>To be aporetic is not about dogmatically claiming that knowledge of some
ideal form is unattainable, for that is the opposite of doubt.  Nor does
it expect one to dismiss every kind of <em>proximate certitude</em> because it
is not “good enough”, as that too would be presumptuous: it would
attempt to render void the actual while holding it against a potentially
speculative ideal, without being in a position to suggest an improved
alternative.  This is a matter of pragmatism, where something is better
than nothing, so long as it does not create impediments to further
research, such as entertaining a working hypothesis while being prepared
to abandon it in favour of a more comprehensive theory.</p>

<p>Aporeticism is, quite simply, the attitude of not taking oneself too
seriously, not committing to a given position with unflinching faith,
and not settling with whatever established or conventional wisdom may
find currency.  One does accept intermediate forms of certainty that
yield practical benefits, that offer some degree of knowledge or
facilitate the advancement of a given research programme, though always
remains open to the possibility of reviewing their stance once the
parameters or specifics of the case undergo change.</p>

<p>Aporeticism conditions one to be prepared for a kind of zig-zag movement
in their progress towards approximating the truth.  To go back and forth
is perfectly fine, provided you do not lose sight of the objective.
This is what we normally mean when we wish to “keep an open mind” about
a given issue.  We hint at our adaptability to evolving states of
affairs.  Doing so requires another attitude: that of being <em>zetetic</em>
(inquisitive).  The whole point of doubting is to provide an impetus for
further research.  To press on with the task of approximating the truth,
to ask more questions and to seek answers, and to do so again and again.</p>

<p>To have parrhesia, to be aporetic and zetetic, are part of the same mode
of conduct.  These virtues are inseparable when studied <em>in vivo</em>.  What
we outline here are mere analytical constructs: they are made separate
in our mind.</p>

<p>As noted above, dialectic is an inter-personal affair.  The virtues of
character documented herein must be present in all parties to the
dialogue.  Without reciprocity there can be no dialectic.  When one
seeks to “win the argument”, they are not doing philosophy.  They are
picking up a verbal fight, a battle of wits, if you will.  They are
being <em>eristic</em> (combative) and, by extension, egotistic and
antagonistic.  Their ulterior motive compels them to deviate from the
path that leads to the truth in pursuit of some ephemeral gain.</p>

<p>The dialecticians are not preoccupied with bonus points on some
meaningless chart that tracks scores, more commonly conceived as social
status, economic standing, popularity…  They care about working together
to seek the truth.  To the dialectician’s mind there is no such concern
as the quest for glory, in the sense of staunchly defending their
position despite cogent counter-arguments.  Besides, that would fail the
test of honesty.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common case where the dialectician wins and benefits
from dialectic is when they discover a proposition, theory, method, that
approximates the truth in a manner that is superior to what was possible
prior to such a discovery.  To “lose the argument” by admitting one’s
position to be untenable is, in fact, a blessing, a win of the highest
order: one is emancipated from a falsehood that kept them away from the
truth and is inspired to renew their zetetic spirit.</p>

<p>Dialectic is all about humility.  You learn to be humble by exposing the
emptiness of your once-cherished beliefs, for that is how your knowledge
evolves.  You collaborate with other parties to partake in the pleasure
of finding out that you were all wrong and some other thesis is required
to help you approximate the truth.  And when you are faced with
uncertainty, you recognise it for what it is and accept its potentially
unfathomable consequences.  Such is the bliss of not taking oneself too
seriously and having the parrhesia to do so in the presence of others.</p>

<p>This ethos is not a set of technical guidelines that we follow only
while engaging in dialectic.  It is a highly demanding lifestyle, not
the pastime activity of some idle scholar who blithely teaches one thing
in the laboratory while lacking the integrity of character to generalise
it as part of their quotidian behaviour.  The dialectician cannot
tolerate such dissonance in their life.  One embodies those virtues and
lives in accordance with them in a consistent fashion, for they apply
everywhere.</p>

<p>To live with uncertainty, to know one’s limits, one’s very humanity as a
mere factor in the system of systems we conceptualise as “the cosmos”
(or the oikos/ecos, from whence we derive terms such as ecosystem,
ecology, etc.), is to develop a sense of tranquility, a peace of mind
where you are no longer disturbed by the unknown but are instead eager
to expose yourself to it, contrary to your most basic instincts and
intuitions as the animal you are.</p>

<p>The dialectical lifestyle, which is in the sense here considered
equivalent to the sceptical stance on living, is one that leads to
<em>ataraxia</em> (non-disturbance, tranquility of mind).  You overcome the
most fundamental fear of your ego: that of not knowing.  Emancipated
from its grip you ascend with the help of others to a higher vantage
point, so to speak, from where everything is clearer but also from where
you can immediately recognise that your eyes continue to see up to a
certain point on the horizon.</p>

<p>Fear of the unknown does not cloud your judgement, nor does it motivate
you to be dishonest as a means of rationalising your perceived position
of weakness.  Confronting your instinctive impulses allows you to better
understand your tranquil nature and through it to gain a newfound
appreciation of the cosmos in its totality, to the extent you can fathom
it, and of its particularities as experienced in every moment.  This
suggests another way of interpreting parrhesia: courage, fearlessness,
and eagerness to face whatever challenges may arise from the task of
approximating the truth.</p>

<p>Hence comes agnosticism: the admission of not knowing and the implicit
preparedness to live with the consequences.  One cannot be dialectical
and gnostic at the same time, for the latter contradicts the disposition
of dubitativeness and inquisitiveness.  To claim to know, without
sufficient proof that could be objectively verified by other
dialecticians who are not indoctrinated into whatever theory of yours,
is a form of dishonesty; dishonesty that may be latent and, thus, not
readily recognisable, or one that stems from the natural fear of the
unknown that has yet to be addressed.</p>

<p>Agnosticism is another way to describe a modus vivendi that is aporetic
and zetetic, and where the person is equipped with parrhesia to conduct
themselves accordingly.  Here “courage” has an added meaning: the
readiness to venture into the unknown and proceed without end in sight.
It is a matter of mental endurance, to participate in a kind of
life-long marathon run in the vast expanses of the world.</p>

<p>What we gather from those notes is that dialectic presupposes and/or
engenders certain connatural virtues.  The dialectical process starts
from a position of ethics.  Ethos is one’s shared moral character, where
morality is, in essence, the abstract structure of rules that frame,
inform, influence, or otherwise determine the conduct of situational
agents and patients to a given action, elucidated and rendered concrete
as a discourse and set of narratives, or codified commands that are
politically sanctioned and enforced.  It is “shared” because it cannot
materialise unilaterally.  Just as dialectic is an inter-personal
affair, so is morality inter-subjective in nature.  There is no strictly
private ‘dialogue’ as there can be no communication between a sender and
a recipient in the sole presence of an absolute one.  And there can be
no ethics in the narrow confines of a decontextualised individual, where
the distinction between an agent and a patient to a given action no
longer holds.</p>

<p>The dialectician is, just like Diogenis of Sinope (aka “the Cynic”), a
citizen of the cosmos (“cosmou polites” gives us “cosmopolite” and its
derivatives) in the sense that their point of reference and source of
guidance is nature, the approximation of the truth, the world as-is or
as best we can interpret it, though not as human convention or whimsy
wants it to be.  While “citizen” is a metaphor that seeks to capture the
qualities of a literal city-dweller: that they recognise the rules of
the place and live in accordance with them.  So does the dialectician
who studies the cosmic being and lives by whatever rules they may have
identified or partially comprehended as part of their life-long
commitment to the task.</p>

<p>Yet the dialectician’s cosmopolitanism (which probably has nothing in
common with today’s use of the term) does not keep them aloof from the
fray of everyday life.  To study nature is to also recognise the human
species as a social animal; an animal that institutes its collective
life by <a href="https://protesilaos.com/notes-on-rules">setting rules</a>.  The
dialectician does not seek the truth by trying to escape from their
humanity, for that would run contrary to the very notion of examining
the world as-is.  They remain rooted in their actuality which also
encompasses their particular social milieu.  So, as with Socrates, the
dialectician does not abandon their city, opting instead to operate in
their community to, inter alia, remind their fellow citizens that those
who claim to have found the absolute truth are delusional and dishonest.</p>

<p>The dialectician is tasked to at once live in the cosmos and in the
city, the space and the place, the general and the particular, and,
equipped with their uncompromising ethos, contribute back to humanity’s
stock of knowledge.  As Plato would suggest, the dialectician must not
abandon their comrades back in the cave.  They must instead descend yet
again and try to help them escape from the shadow play that presents
their ignorance as knowledge, their hubris as boldness, their pretences
to intellectuality as wisdom.</p>

<p>This reveals a mindset of sharing know-how that <a href="https://protesilaos.com/fables-on-systems/">we could
describe</a> as the “Promethean
ideal”, in reference to the myth of Prometheus who taught humanity the
technology of wielding fire, without fearing the inevitable punishment.
The dialectician is guided by this paradigm to make their findings
accessible to as many of their peers as they can.  Again, like Socrates,
one remains approachable and close to their neighbours.  This links back
to honesty and plain-spoken-ness.</p>

<p>The dialectician is your friendly, albeit demanding and strict,
neighbour who remains part of your community, though not as a sycophant,
a cheerleader of the establishment, but as a benevolent, tenacious
critic that helps by either sharing knowledge or by exposing falsehoods
for what they are.</p>
