         <p>In this video I demonstrate some of the commands I have for working with
the built-in version control (VC) framework and, specifically, its Git
back-end.  Those offer a layer of interactivity on top of the <code>git</code>
program you normally get on the command line, while the make various VC
interfaces easier to use.</p>

<p>Refer to my Emacs configuration file (“dotemacs”) for the implementation
details: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.  The specific item that
contains those extensions is <code>prot-vc.el</code>.  Everything is part of my
dotfiles’ repository: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles</a>.</p>
