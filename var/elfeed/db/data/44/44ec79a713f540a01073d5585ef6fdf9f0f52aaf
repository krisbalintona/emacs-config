         <p>In this video I demonstrate the text-based web browser that is built
into Emacs: <code>eww</code>, or else the “Emacs Web Wowser”.  While it is quite
usable without any customisations, I have written several extensions for
it to make my quotidian usage a bit more pleasant.</p>

<p>Refer to my Emacs configuration file (“dotemacs”) for the implementation
details: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.  The specific item that
contains those extensions is <code>prot-eww.el</code>.  Everything is part of my
dotfiles’ repository: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles</a>.</p>
