         <p>In this screen cast I demonstrate the main commenting functions that are
exposed by the built-in <code>newcomment</code> library.  Apart from the defaults,
I also discuss the customisations I have introduced and my custom “do
what I mean” function that I implemented to suit my use-case.</p>

<p>This demo also shows some practical ways of accessing documentation in
Emacs, for libraries, key bindings, variables, functions.  This is the
“self-documenting” editor, after all…</p>

<p>And here is the link to my configuration file, with all the settings I
showed in the video as well as everything else from previous screen
casts: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>
