<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The objective of this publication is to argue that the European Union
can be understood as an experiment in transnational democracy. In the
present handbook we indirectly examine how this organisation does not
fit into any of the existing models for classifying political
entities. Though it is a union of states, it is neither a federation nor
a confederation. While it is founded on inter-state treaties, it is not
like any other international organisation. Even though its legislation
is legally binding, it is not a sovereign nation state.</p>

<p>What contributes to such indeterminacy is the very nature of European
integration. It is a <strong>process</strong> that brings together different nation
states, each with their own unique characteristics and traditions, with
the objective of selectively harmonising areas of policy. By “European
integration” we are actually referring to a method for standardising
legislation across countries that are members of this
organisation. These countries, formally referred to as the European
Union Member States, are jointly participating in an array of procedures
for bringing about the eventuality of rule standardisation.</p>

<p>If we were to describe the European integration process in a single
phrase, it would have to be “cross-border harmonisation”. To understand
why that may be the case, and why European leaders find it worthwhile to
provide for a common basis for legal provisions and policy targets, we
need to consider European history. The European nations were
traditionally divided, each developing its own political culture and
state structures. To a larger or lesser extent, every European nation
that now is a Member State of the EU has had its own historical
trajectory as a <strong>nation state</strong>. From a supranational perspective, each of
these paths led to a different direction, eventually contributing to a
Europe-wide heterogeneity. Though divisions are a near-permanent feature
in European history, it arguably was the experience of two World Wars
that made Europeans realise the need for forging closer ties among their
nations for the preservation of continent-wide peace. Although conceived
to prevent another major war, the first European Communities were
economic projects: agreements for gradually developing an area of free
trade. With the creation of the European Union, the integration process
has, at least in principle, assumed a more ambitious telos: the
political unification of Europe.</p>

<p>Examined in its own capacity, every <strong>stable</strong> state is a peace project
among its people. It is a political organisation meant to preserve, at
the very least, the public goods of order, security, and health. These
are not the only ethical items of a polity. They are however the minimum
for preventing lawlessness and internal conflict. Without a certain set
of rules, be they codified in law or not, and in the absence of
inter-personal qualities for guaranteeing general stability, there can
be no functioning state, no organised society. Seen in relation to other
states, a stable state can be a degree of peace or a sense of
togetherness that is achieved at the expense of other peoples, which
amounts to a global “win-lose” situation, where one side gains at the
expense of another. That used to be the norm in European power struggles
prior to the second half of the 20th century. The European integration
process represents a certain change in that regard. It also is a peace
project, albeit one that is <strong>among</strong> stable states: a “win-win” situation,
meant to decisively prevent strife on an inter-state level.</p>

<p>A modern republic is not established solely for the purposes of public
order, security, and health. There are other values for legitimising a
state, most notably the arrangements of power distribution that make up
a democracy which functions in accordance with the rule of law. To those
we may add economic objectives manifesting in the capacity of
individuals to make choices in supplying or demanding goods and
services; social considerations such as the distribution of resources,
the equal status among social groups, each with their recognition and
respect for their unique characteristics; cultural ends like the
empowerment of persons through art and self expression, or the equal
opportunities for education and participation in the commons; ecological
awareness, expressed as respect for the environment, protection of
biodiversity, and the overall adaptation of human social experience to
nature’s limits. To that end, European integration is not <strong>just</strong> a peace
project, but an overarching ambition to deliver the public goods of a
modern republic on a continental level and in a trans-national-border
fashion. Transnational democracy is our criterion for judging the
European Union. We are, in other words, applying republican principles
on a scale <strong>beyond</strong> the nation state, though not against its normative
achievements.</p>

<p>This handbook is divided into three parts. The first concerns the
overall design of the European Union, the second is dedicated to the
euro, while the third focuses on political theory in order to flesh out
the fundamental sovereignty mismatch of the present order. Ultimately
though, the themes under consideration do not exhaust the broader
subject of European integration. They merely contribute to one’s
thinking when examining day-to-day European affairs.</p>

<p><a id="h:464efd6e-80d1-43c7-a5ed-b7b8caa4b145"></a></p>

<h2>The European Union</h2>

<p>In this first part we shed light on some of the main features of the
European integration process and how these relate to the institutional
order of the European Union.</p>

<p>The European Union is in many ways a unique political organisation. We
may use particular areas of policy to describe its system, such as
monetary policy to suggest that it is a federation, or foreign and
security policy to argue that it is a confederation. While existing
models of state can be useful in guiding our thinking, their rather
fixed significations may also obfuscate some of the EU’s
peculiarities. To suggest that the EU is a federation or a confederation
can be a way of describing the distribution of authority between the
national and the supranational levels, yet it can also provide for an
erroneous perception of aspects of European policy that otherwise do not
conform with such a narrative.</p>

<p>European integration is a <strong>process</strong>. When we try to use an existing model
we commit the error of treating European integration as mostly static
and largely complete, as <strong>already made</strong>. Whereas to perceive of it as a
process means to consider it in a state of flux, as being <strong>in the
making</strong>. We may describe the actual system of the EU in negative terms,
as <strong>not being</strong> a typical federation, confederation, or international
organisation. The venture becomes more complicated when attempting to
positively define it, as to what it actually <strong>is</strong>. To this end, one should
be mindful of the EU’s incompleteness, so that any claim on its
actuality is provided with the proviso that it may not be entirely
accurate.</p>

<p>It is common to refer to the EU as a polity <strong>sui generis</strong>, standing in a
league of its own. While that may help us avoid the direct comparisons
with existing political systems, it can imply that we do indeed know
what this unique kind is: that we can, in other words, properly define
it. The problem with definitions along those lines is that they try to
provide for a uniform description of an otherwise heteroclite
whole. Perhaps the safest generalisation one can make is that there are
areas of European policy that can be understood as federal, others as
confederal, others as intergovernmental. However these cannot be reduced
to each other: an intergovernmental formation cannot also be a
federation, a federated system differs from a confederation, and so on.</p>

<p>Still, the European Union is not fundamentally indeterminate. What we
are arguing for is that the method used needs to account for its nature
as <strong>becoming</strong>. To that end, we attempt to study the specifics, to discern
commonalities in the multitude of phenomena for understanding this new
form of polity. This is a positivist exercise, yet one which provides
for a relatively higher degree of uncertainty in not offering a final
judgement.</p>

<p><a id="h:390a7678-cab2-443e-ab5d-46166bc7423b"></a></p>

<h2>The gradualist tradition</h2>

<p>Though the ultimate end of the European Union is the political
unification of Europe, the European integration process did not start
with such a lofty ambition. While there were voices following the end of
World War II calling for a “United States of Europe”, mostly notably
Winston Churchill, as well as attempts at creating a European Political
Community, the first European Communities were much narrower in
scope. They were trade agreements between six countries: France, Italy,
[West] Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Officially, <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/index_en.htm">European integration starts</a> with the European Coal and Steel
Community, established in the early 1950s. It was an inter-state
agreement meant to dismantle barriers to trade in perhaps the
predominant industries of the time, those of coal and steel. The idea of
free trade between countries was broadened with the Treaty of Rome,
signed in 1957 and ratified a year later, which established the European
Economic Community (EEC), the EU’s predecessor. The objective of the EEC
was the creation of a customs union that would eventually encompass the
four core freedoms of the common market, namely the free movement of
goods, persons, services, and capital. We may consider the creation of
the single market as the first stage of European integration.</p>

<p>Change was slow and often had to depend on landmark rulings from the
European Court of Justice, such as the <strong>Van Gend en Loos</strong> case which
asserted the Direct Effect of European Law, or the case commonly
referred to as “Casis de Dijon” (after a French liquor) which made a
breakthrough in the prohibition of indirect impediments to cross-border
trade.</p>

<p>In 1992 with the end of the Cold War and with the European common market
having matured over the decades, European leaders proceeded with the
signing of the Treaty of Maastricht. It was a turning point, ushering in
the second stage of integration that would see the common market become
but one of the pillars of a new, much more ambitious entity, the
European Union. In line with broadening the scope of the integration
process, there was to be an Economic and Monetary Union, with the euro
envisaged as the official currency of the EU (the opt-outs of the United
Kingdom and Denmark are exceptions to the rule). Each Member State
committed to a set of convergence criteria—the Maastricht criteria—for
eventually adopting the single currency, such as provisions on the level
of the budget deficit, public debt, inflation, and long-term interest
rates.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Lisbon, the last in a series, has improved and streamlined
the Maastricht architecture, with the most notable change from a
parliamentary perspective being the expansion of the European
Parliament’s power and influence, by virtue of the ordinary legislative
procedure becoming the standard method for producing European
legislation.</p>

<p>As of today, the European Union is founded on two Treaties, the Treaty
on European Union (TEU), and the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (TFEU). Both have the same legal value. Meanwhile, the
Member States of the EU have grown from the original six to twenty
eight.</p>

<p>What this historical overview tells us is that the overarching theme of
European integration is that of gradual changes to an ever expanding
corpus of law, also known as the <strong>acquis communautaire</strong> or the Community
acquis. We may name the method by which European integration is pursued
step-by-step as <strong>gradualism</strong>. This is not really a political ideology, but
a way of achieving progress through multilateral negotiations in
awareness of Europe’s history as a largely heterogeneous collection of
nation states.</p>

<p>The implicit and arguably valid assumption of gradualism is that any
sentiment of “Europeanness” is secondary to feelings of national
belonging and, hence, any attempt to unite the Europeans has to be made
in relation to some practical need for collaboration rather than a more
idealist narrative for togetherness. National sensitivities must be
respected, otherwise it will be Europe that will fall out of favour in
cases where a conflict of identities is perceived as taking place. In
effect, this means that nation states must commit to modes of policy
coordination that do not undermine their very presence. The European
level is, from a national government’s perspective, the theatre of
intergovernmental relations, which are formalised in the inter-state
treaties that found the European Union and which are framed by the
supranational secondary legislation stemming therefrom. These treaties,
which serve as the <strong>de facto constitution</strong> of the European Union,
substantiate a rule-forming-rule-making stratum that is <strong>above</strong> yet
decisively <strong>with</strong> the governments of the Member States.</p>

<p>Essential to gradualism are three items: (1) the <strong>functional
necessity</strong> for broadening and deepening integration, (2) the pursuit of
<strong>top-down politics</strong>, understood as high-level intergovernmental
relations being the driving force of integration, and (3) the spirit of
<strong>intergovernmentalism</strong> as the pragmatic way of reaching consensus
between nation states within the framework of European law.</p>

<p>Understanding gradualism is important for anticipating future
integration. While it may be argued that a quantum leap is needed for
decisively addressing some of the EU’s shortcomings, it is highly
unlikely, based on the prevailing conditions, that a radical reform of
the system will occur over the next decade or so. We now are in the
phase of backstage negotiations on a future Treaty amendment. One can
only speculate what its content may be. It may push European integration
to its third stage, that of eventually becoming a political union of
sorts, it might roll back parts of the acquis, or even create some new
state of affairs.</p>

<p>What is more concrete at this stage is an action plan titled “Completing
Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union”, which was published on June
22, 2015. This is also known as <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/economic-monetary-union/five-presidents-report/index_en.htm">the Five Presidents’
Report</a>,
courtesy of its five signatories: European Commission President
<strong>Jean-Claude Juncker</strong>, President of the European Council <strong>Donald
Tusk</strong>, Eurogroup President <strong>Jeroen Dijsselbloem</strong>, President of the
European Central Bank <strong>Mario Draghi</strong>, and the President of the
European Parliament <strong>Martin Schulz</strong>. The ambition of this document is
to do as much as the current Treaties allow for in enhancing economic
governance and completing the banking union. Eventually though, it
intends to introduce reforms that would require a new Treaty, such as
providing the supranational level with a fiscal capacity (to raise
taxes, issue debt, engage in autonomous spending) commensurate with
political legitimation and accountability.</p>

<p>True to tradition, the five presidents are as gradualist in their stated
ambition as one would come to expect. While the European Union will be
reformed, it is safe to assume no major change will happen overnight.</p>

<p><a id="h:f688159e-8438-488f-8827-16411e09d3e1"></a></p>

<h2>Rule forming and rule making</h2>

<p>The European institutions are horizontally separated in line with the
principle of the division of powers. The executive function is trusted
in the European Commission, the legislative in the institutions of the
European Parliament and the Council of the EU, the judiciary in the
Court of Justice of the EU, the monetary in the European Central Bank,
the auditory in the European Court of Auditors. The one institution
which complicates things is the European Council, for it performs none
of the aforementioned functions yet is the ultimate decider on all
things concerning EU politics. The European Council is the formalised
body of the heads of state or government of all the Member States. While
it does have a president who serves a fixed term, it remains an
intergovernmental entity that aims at producing consensual agreements
between the national governments on the future direction of the European
integration process.</p>

<p>One would expect the executive to be the entity deciding on the
political direction of the Union, always in concert with the
legislative, and in accordance with the legal order. It is the role of
governments to take decisions that influence—indeed determine—their
outlook as well as the future options of subsequent governments. For
instance, it is up to the United Kingdom’s government to decide on the
qualitative features of their country’s referendum on EU Membership:
what the exact question will be, whether there will also be a referendum
on a possible renegotiated package, what the specific demands may be for
changing their relationship with the EU, and so on.</p>

<p>Though the European Commission is the executive, it is not the European
government, at least not in the sense we would think of any other
government. The Commission does indeed perform almost all of the tasks
of an executive, proposing legislation, foreseeing its implementation,
providing technical expertise on all areas of policy that fall within
its competences, etc. What the Commission lacks is the capacity of
taking final decisions on what rules will be created. This power is left
with the European Council. It is the latter institution which decides on
what the outlook of European integration may be, and which areas of
policy require further harmonisation. The Commission takes all necessary
measures for realising the European Council’s guidance, typically by
putting forth a legislative proposal. Thus, while the Commission is the
European “government”, it has an overseer, an institution which provides
it with its mandate.</p>

<p>To better describe this kind of institutional order, we may employ terms
or phrases that denote what each of the institutions does in the
creation of the EU’s rules. Since the European Council does not get
involved in the technical aspect of law-making, we may argue that its
role is that of <strong>rule formation</strong>. The European Council forms the rules by
virtue of deciding on the direction and scope of future integration. In
effect, the European Council instructs the Commission to pursue certain
goals. The Commission is tasked with fleshing out in precise detail the
specifics of its mandate, usually by means of initiating the ordinary
legislative procedure, which involves the European Parliament and the
Council of the EU as co-legislative institutions. We can suggest that
the legislative process, with all its technicalities and complexity, is
where the European Union’s <strong>rule making</strong> takes place.</p>

<p>Whether this state of affairs is optimal or not remains a matter of
one’s judgement. For the present author, this is considered suboptimal
even though it does extend an otherwise sound principle: the division of
powers. The flaw is identified in the European Council’s accountability
structures. One would expect the final decider to be accountable to a
body politic commensurate with the reach of its authority, just as a
country’s government is accountable to the country’s citizens. The
European Council is an intergovernmental entity, which means that any
one of its members, the political leader of each Member State, is only
accountable to their own citizens. The collection of national leaders is
not accountable <strong>as a body</strong> to a unified citizenry, to a European
demos. As will be discussed at the end of this handbook, this reflects
the fundamental flaw of the European Union’s current
rule-forming-rule-making design: its <strong>sovereignty mismatch</strong>.</p>

<p>Though the EU is still far from being a federal republic, it could still
benefit from a change in the legitimacy and accountability of its
supranational decider. Should Treaty amendments be considered in the
near future, it would be desirable to reform the relationship between
the European Council (and its quasi-legal subset, the Eurogroup) and the
rest of the institutions. One can envisage the adaptation of the current
bifurcation of powers between European Council and European Commission,
so that a new executive could be introduced that would perform the
function of forming the rules as well as participate in their
making. This would involve a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a European Administration as a successor institution to the European
Council, preferably a directly elected one or, at the very least, one
appointed by the Member States following approval from the European
Parliament;</li>
  <li>the remodelling of the European Commission into a purely technocratic
entity, a public service, tasked solely with providing its technical
expertise in the making of legislation, and in being a true “guardian
of the Treaties” by monitoring the compliance of Member States with
the Union’s legal order.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently the European Commission consists of twenty eight
commissioners, each from a Member State. These Commissioners are high
profile politicians. Though it is understandable that in the spirit of
consensus every country gets to have a Commissioner, this set-up is not
particularly desirable for at least three reasons: (i) it politicises
the Commission, thus creating a tension between its actuality as a
political entity and its objective as an impartial guardian of the
Treaties, (ii) it forces the Commission’s president to come up with ever
more roles to give work to individual Commissioners, so that they
effectively end up with seemingly overlapping tasks, and (iii) the
European Commission is a purely supranational institution and should
have a clear status as such, distinguishing it from other
intergovernmental entities.</p>

<p>A reformed Commission would see it reduced in political gravitas, so as
to be best suited for the crucial technical role it has to assume. The
direct input of Member States is already provided in the legislative
institution of the Council of the EU, making any further involvement an
unnecessary duplication of representation. In such a new institutional
arrangement with a reformed bifurcated executive, a convention of Member
States’ leaders would only be foreseen for the purposes of deciding on
amendments to the European Treaties.</p>

<p>Understandably, none of these reforms may take place. At this point they
remain purely theoretical, even though they are empirically informed
from the EU’s peculiarity of having distinct entities that <strong>form</strong> and then
<strong>make</strong> the rules. Rule formation and rule making can very well be
preserved in a Treaty change that will otherwise improve the overall
legitimacy and accountability of the supranational stratum of authority,
all while respecting—and being in line with—the interests of the Member
States.</p>

<p><a id="h:dfa6ca69-6d9a-40bd-916b-990ef1b9f6f6"></a></p>

<h2>Limitations of the European Parliament</h2>

<p>The European Parliament performs the main function of any other
parliament: to decide on the content of legislation. While that may
qualify it as adequate for the purposes of fulfilling its law-making
role, it does indeed face certain limitations in its power, all of which
have to do with the nature of the European Union as a union of states
that is not yet a federal republic.</p>

<p>There are three limitations to the Parliament’s scope, namely: (1) no
legislative initiative, (2) constrained budgetary powers, (3) no
institutional role in controlling rule forming entities.</p>

<p>Within the context of the ordinary legislative procedure, which is the
main modus operandi for producing secondary legislation, only the
European Commission has the right to initiate the process. The
Commission sends its draft law to both co-legislative institutions, the
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which are
then tasked with agreeing on a common text. What this means is that the
legislative function is only capable of <strong>reacting</strong> to a proposal from the
executive. All the Parliament can do in terms of an initiative, is to
ask the Commission to produce a certain draft for a new piece of
legislation, which will then be subject to the ordinary legislative
procedure. The inability to outright initiate the law-making process
implies the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the Parliament’s own-initiative reports are not legally binding;</li>
  <li>it cannot be the prime mover in the effort to amend or repeal
existing legislation;</li>
  <li>it may not fulfil its democratic mandate in formally expressing the
demands of European citizens (such as those that gain momentum
through the European Citizens’ Initiative).</li>
</ol>

<p>As concerns budgetary powers, the Parliament has to conform with the
EU’s peculiarity of having a multiannual budgetary framework, formally
known as the Multiannual Financial Framework. Also and given that the EU
does not have a fiscal capacity of its own (the power to, inter alia,
raise taxes and issue debt), all of the budget’s funds come from
national contributions. This means that intergovernmental bargaining
takes place prior to the introduction of a new MFF, for the purposes of
deciding on the appropriation and upper limits of the funding
arrangements. The main role of the European Parliament is to make
amendments to the inner distribution of any given set of resources, as
well as have a final say on the MFF <strong>as a package</strong>. It cannot have a
position on either the distribution or the ceilings concerning each area
of spending. Put simply, the Parliament cannot decide to take resources
from agricultural policy and reallocate them to
infrastructure. Ultimately though, the rather minor impact on the MFF
means that no parliamentary majority is capable of shaping the EU’s
fiscal stance to adopt an expansionary or contractionary policy in
accordance with the business cycle.</p>

<p>In recent years, where the Parliament’s weakness has been most apparent
is its inability to scrutinise the rule forming entities of the European
Union (European Council and Eurogroup), as well as hold accountable the
various intergovernmental arrangements that have been set up as a
response to the euro crisis, most notably the so-called
“troika”—officials from the European Commission, International Monetary
Fund, European Central Bank—and the European Stability Mechanism. As
concerns the rule forming entities, the Parliament cannot hold each of
them accountable <strong>as a body</strong>, for they are comprised of national
representatives who only answer to their respective parliaments and
electorates. This means that the rule forming entities are answerable to
no parliament or citizenry <strong>as collectives</strong>. As for the instruments that
deal with the euro crisis, including the ESM, these are purely
intergovernmental in nature, which puts them in the same league as the
rule forming entities. Similarly, the European Parliament has no right
to scrutinise the International Monetary Fund: the bailout programmes
under the troika’s supervision are multilateral agreements whose
“ownership” is attributed to the nation state receiving the financial
support, so that accountability, if any, remains at the national level.</p>

<p>These limitations notwithstanding, the European Parliament has over the
decades become an important player in European affairs. With the Treaty
of Lisbon making the ordinary legislative procedure the default mode for
producing secondary law, the Parliament has a key role to play in
determining the content of legislation. To that end, we may consider any
limitations to the European Parliament’s power as germane to European
integration, in particular the fact that the EU is still not a
sovereign, constitution-based republic with full fledged legislative and
executive functions. The Parliament’s weaknesses are quite apparent,
though they would require relatively minor reforms to be addressed, such
the right to a legislative initiative, a more meaningful involvement in
the EU budget, and the right to hold accountable the rule forming
entities.</p>

<p>As for the inability of the European Parliament to decide on its own
seat, it is not entirely clear whether this is a flaw of the Parliament
or an inherent constraint of unanimity-based decision-making between
national governments. Perhaps the latter is a more plausible
explanation, since it ultimately is the veto power of the French
government which forces the rest of official Europe to persevere the
ordeal of travelling from Brussels to Strasbourg to hold at least twelve
plenary sessions per year. This will remain the case for as long as the
permanent seat of a European institution is treated as a matter of
symbolism rather than practical reason. Ultimately though, this issue is
not substantive as it does not have an impact on the general role of the
European Parliament and, therefore, should not be given more attention
than the above three limitations to parliamentary power.</p>

<h2>The euro</h2>

<p>In this second part of the handbook we turn our attention to the euro,
examining its framework of economic governance, its paradoxical
statelessness, and the institutional independence of the European
Central Bank.</p>

<p>The euro is the official currency of the European Union. While there
still are Member States who use their national currency, all are obliged
to eventually adopt the euro. Exceptions to this rule are the United
Kingdom and Denmark, which have negotiated opt-outs from the monetary
union.</p>

<p>From the perspective of European integration, the euro is not just an
international reserve currency. The creation of the euro coincided with
the transformation of the European Economic Community into the European
Union. This was set in place with the Treaty of Maastricht, signed
in 1992. What the European leaders sought to initiate after the end of
the Cold War was a new stage in the integration process that would see
the European Community move beyond trade liberalisation and the
establishment of the common market toward political unification. The
euro with the concomitant monetary union was conceived as the best
starting point for bringing about the eventuality of political union.</p>

<p>The idea was that the material changes brought about by the introduction
of a single currency would eventually point to the need for harmonising
areas of policy that were traditionally kept at the national level, such
as economic and fiscal policy, and bank supervision. The euro would
broaden the scope of—as well as accelerate—the integration process,
while the uniform monetary policy would have positive spillover effects
on all other areas of economic activity and planning. Once a higher
degree of legitimacy and accountability would be needed, political union
would come as a necessary and desirable extension of changes on the
ground. It would be the last part of the puzzle.</p>

<p>This approach has had its shortcomings, already prior to the post-2008
financial crisis. The original design of the monetary union was
predicated on some brave and ultimately erroneous assumptions about
economic realities. One was that largely diverse national economic
structures could organically converge without any close coordination or
active involvement from policy-makers at the supranational level. A
second wishful thought was that cross-border capital markets would
emerge in spite of the compartmentalisation of banking policy along
national lines. A third misguided belief was that a central bank can
indeed be the sole institution in charge of the monetary union, without
any need for a system-wide fiscal backstop, and a counter-party treasury
capable of adapting fiscal policy to area-wide fluctuations along the
business cycle.</p>

<p>From a purely economic standpoint, the euro should not have been
introduced under the conditions it did. Though one can argue that the
original euro was “minimal” that would not capture its actuality, for
minimalism entails sufficiency. Europe’s monetary union was not viable
in its original form. It was incomplete and insufficient for pursuing
its stated objectives. The erratic capital flows in its first years
already indicated the inability of the system to correct its own
self-destructive propensities. Yet it was the economic shock following
the collapse of Lehman Brothers that exposed all of the monetary union’s
inadequacies, forcing policy-makers to actually focus on addressing the
errors of the euro’s architects.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it has to be noted that there is nothing about the European
integration process which could reduce it to a “purely economic”
project. Even when trade liberalisation was its primary objective,
integration was profoundly political. The transition from the European
Economic Community to the European Union, coupled with the introduction
of the single currency, has only made the political nature of the
project more apparent. Couched in those terms, one ought not
underestimate the political capital invested in the euro. While the
concurrent financial and debt crises have mired the European economy in
near-stagnation and disinflation, and though the entire system was
subject to duress and could have collapsed under the pressure, the euro
remains, despite its persistent design flaws, the main driver for the
realisation of the ultimate objective of the European Union: the
formation of a transnational republic.</p>

<p>For the purposes of European integration the euro is much more than just
fiat money. It is the catalyst in the efforts to deepen and broaden
cross-border harmonisation. The very evolution of Europe’s Economic and
Monetary Union provides such an insight. The original design of the euro
was predicated on a monetarist conception of a single currency area. A
fully independent central bank, the European Central Bank, was provided
with a rather narrow mandate for targeting inflation. Fiscal policy
remained primarily national, though a limited set of supranational rules
were established for standardising the procedures and relevant
targets. There were no instruments for carrying out area-wide stress
tests for private banks, while the European Central Bank did not have
the necessary tools for conducting micro- and macro- prudential
policy. The currency area was left largely unfinished. An incorrectly
decentralised monetary union, one without a fiscal, banking, and
political capacity, was prone to abuses of its own rules by Member
States that realised they could rig the rules with impunity. Meanwhile,
the entire edifice remained exposed to external shocks as well as
internal asymmetries. The Great Recession exposed the weaknesses of that
model, with Europeans having to pay a very high cost for their leaders’
lack of foresight when deciding on the specifics of the euro.</p>

<p>The policy response to the financial shock, notwithstanding some of the
ad hoc mechanisms that were introduced for bailing out individual states
that had lost access to international money markets, was a means of
retroactively correcting the frailties of the monetary union. Provisions
for concerted economic governance were introduced with the intention to
centralise fiscal policy at the supranational level. In such a legal
order, the fiscal sovereignty of Member States has already been deprived
of most of its substance, since every national government has to comply
with an extensive set of common rules.</p>

<p>What currently is in place falls short of delivering a credible solution
to the inadequacies of the Economic and Monetary Union. The next steps
in the European integration process are meant to further strengthen the
EMU by providing it with an embryonic capacity for autonomous fiscal
policy as well as creating a basis for a unified banking sector. Perhaps
changes will be made that will enable the supranational level to act as
an economic government, though it is too early in the process to
accurately estimate the immediate steps forward. Much of what we will
witness in the foreseeable future depends on the presidential elections
in France, as well as the outcome of the United Kingdom’s attempts at
renegotiating its place in the European Union. The year 2017 will likely
be the starting point of a new phase in the integration process, one
whose qualitative features are contingent on a series of events over the
coming months.</p>

<h2>The statelessness of the euro</h2>

<p>It perhaps is presumptuous to elaborate on a chapter that asserts the
statelessness of the euro. This is, after all, a perfectly good
currency: fiat money issued by an institutionally independent central
bank that is the legal tender of nineteen European Union Member States,
representing a total population of around 340 million people. The euro
actually is the official currency of the European Union, so any claim on
its statelessness seems tenuous at best.</p>

<p>While these are valid considerations, the fact is that the political
entity whose fiat makes the euro a legitimate currency—the EU—is not
actually a sovereign state, certainly not in terms of its international
standing. Though every Member State whose currency is the euro does have
an international personality as sovereign, the euro is not any one
nation’s currency, for it is shared among a group of states. What is
here meant by “statelessness” is simply the realisation that the
supranational level where this shared reality is made manifest is not
qualified as sovereign. As was noted in the first part of the handbook,
the European Union is a union of states founded on inter-state treaties,
whose main feature is an interplay between intergovernmental rule
formation and supranational rule making.</p>

<p>Characteristic of the euro’s stateless nature is the absence of a
government for the system at-large. The Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) is a rules-based formation, an interweaving web of regulations
establishing and defining the qualitative features of economic
governance. Attention should be given to that very last term, since by
“governance” we do not signify a person, political body or institution,
but only a set of provisions that are supposed to be implemented by
national governments with the guidance, support, and involvement of
certain EU institutions, primarily the European Commission, and under
pressure from their peers.</p>

<p>The closest approximation to a government of the euro is the European
Council, the rule forming institution consisting of the heads of state
or government of the EU Member States. However, since the euro area and
the broader EU represent different degrees of integration, the former
being much deeper than the latter, the intergovernmental entity that may
best qualify as a pseudo government of the euro is the Eurogroup: <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/eurogroup/">an
informal entity</a> made up of the finance ministers of the states whose
currency is the euro.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, neither the European Council nor the Eurogroup may
qualify as a proper government, for none of them performs the vast
majority of the executive functions: those are trusted in the European
Commission.</p>

<p>In the absence of a clearly-delineated decider, the only way to regulate
Europe’s single currency is to rely on a far-reaching nexus of rules
that are legally binding on all of its Member States. The two-pack and
six-pack of Community regulations as well as the Fiscal Compact
(formally referred to as the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and
Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) provide the framework
within which economic governance takes place. These rules focus on
budgetary surveillance and economic coordination, which are meant to
achieve the two-fold objective of (i) keeping states aligned with the
Maastricht criteria, especially the targets on budget deficit and public
debt, and (ii) preventing the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances.</p>

<p>The shortcomings of a uniformly rules-based system can be summarised
thus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Decontextualisation:</strong> the targets are predetermined, permanent and
legally-binding, implying that neither the prevailing economic
conditions nor the peculiar needs of each country are considered in
the impact assessment of the policies that need to be introduced by
virtue of European law.</li>
  <li><strong>Retroactivity:</strong> the rules on economic governance, albeit anchored in
the European Treaties or prior institutional arrangements, are to a
large extent the product of the EU’s reaction to the financial
crisis. It is no surprise that the provisions therein are geared on
limiting budget deficits and public debts, while monitoring
macroeconomic imbalances, for these are perceived as the ultimate
causes of the concurrent sovereign debt and banking crises. While
understandable, this approach is not the most prudent, as it provides
a solution to a crisis that has, for the most part, already run its
course. There are no flexible instruments for dealing with new and
emerging challenges that are beyond the scope of the existing legal
framework. In such a scenario decision-makers will again be caught
unprepared, seeking to produce yet another retroactive response.</li>
  <li><strong>Arbitrariness:</strong> the European Semester, where economic governance
takes place, is a heavily modified version of the Open Method of
Coordination. This is a largely intergovernmental instrument involving
EU institutions that seeks to harmonise the procedures while relying
on “peer pressure” for the enforcement of the rules. What may first
appear as a structure that guarantees the equality of Member States,
is in fact a recipe for potentially abusive conduct. Inter-state
affairs are subject to situational power relations, where it is more
expedient to elaborate on some quid pro quo than force a given
government to conform with its obligations and commitments. We thus
can have arbitrariness in the form of intergovernmental bargaining
that occurs behind closed doors.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflexibility:</strong> the rules are rather fixed in an effort to limit
disputes over interpretation, as well as minimise the margin for
discretion. This has been considered the most preferable state of
affairs as it would otherwise be near impossible to achieve the
desired end of a more centralised control on economic policy. Yet the
inflexibility of the rules can, in and of itself, be a cause for
crisis, as it engenders a certain behaviour of prioritising
formalities over substance, which can lead to the implementation of
policies that exacerbate rather than ameliorate an economic
slowdown. A law-abiding national government may have to introduce
spending cuts because the rules demand so, not due to some immediate
practical necessity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the system was a federal republic, we would have a European
government capable of implementing measures in line with evolving needs
and conditions, being proactive, and acting in a flexible way wherever
necessary, always within a comprehensive legal framework that would
prevent the disproportionate centralisation of power. The euro as it
currently stands leaves much to be desired. From a technical
perspective, it hampers any effort to conduct rational economic
policy. By “rational” one must also signify “context-aware”, for the
optimality of a certain measure can only be understood in relative
terms, in relation to the interoperating factors of the case. The euro
has to be reformed, something that the Five Presidents’ Report also
admits. As the euro crisis has shown, the statelessness of the EU’s
official currency cannot be preserved without cost to the integration
process.</p>

<p><a id="h:af982eac-4e82-4505-b3b7-2d86fd5dd8e5"></a></p>

<h2>Shared sovereignty and shared responsibility</h2>

<p>Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is often described as a
formation of states enjoying a shared sovereignty. Euro area Member
States have bound themselves together under a single currency by means
of forgoing their sovereign authority over monetary policy. An
independent institution, the European Central Bank, is tasked with the
monetary function, mandated to pursue a policy of inflation targeting
that aims at a medium-term price level increase that is “below but close
to 2%”.</p>

<p>To improve the stability of the entire edifice, euro Member States also
commit to a set of targets regarding various economic magnitudes,
including those peculiar to fiscal policy. In recent years and as a
response to the [ongoing] economic crisis, the EMU rule-set has been
expanded to include such instruments as the European Semester aimed at
making states concurrently enforce policies that account for a
comprehensive list of macroeconomic indicators covering productivity,
trade balance dynamics, and fiscal solidity.</p>

<p>While these common commitments do provide a basis for appreciating the
structures as <strong>shared</strong>, they do not—and cannot by themselves—foster a
common sovereignty.</p>

<p>Technicalities aside, the contemporary understanding of “sovereignty” is
informed by the Peace Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 C.E. Prior to that,
the legitimacy of the state, the justification for its authority over a
group of people, resided in the supposed divinity of the monarch or the
ruling elite. The sovereign was an individual, whereas under the scope
of the Westphalian tenets of statehood, the sovereign became an
impersonal agency: the state, which later evolved into the nation
state. The new principles of that treaty, as well as the inferences
drawn from them over the passing of the ages, contributed to a system of
international politics predicated on [at least] the following items
concerning the substantiation of sovereignty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The hypostatisation of the state as the primary actor of diplomatic
affairs;</li>
  <li>The reification of the state as the agency exercising supreme
authority over a clearly delineated territory;</li>
  <li>The identification of the state with a given people;</li>
  <li>The capacity for self-determination that, when universalised, entails
the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another
state;</li>
  <li>The equal status of states qua states.</li>
</ul>

<p>To judge whether “shared sovereignty” is an accurate term, we may
examine whether the EMU satisfies the criteria on that list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The EMU is not a primary actor in diplomatic affairs and, even if it
did have a unified representation that would not necessarily entail a
sovereign capacity to exercise foreign policy;</li>
  <li>The EMU as such, if assumed to be a sovereign state, does not properly
exercise authority over a given territory, not least because it cannot
maintain its own fiscal policy (issue bonds, raise taxes etc.), it
lacks the right to draw its Exclusive Economic Zone, does not have its
own power to use military might to defend its territory, and so on;</li>
  <li>The EMU does not have its own constituted people, for there still is
no European demos, properly so-called, with the capacity to
participate in—and to formulate—its own politics, and, furthermore,
the system is predicated on a rules-based system for economic
governance in the absence of a government;</li>
  <li>The EMU is not self-determined, as its Member States are the ones to
define its sphere of influence and modalities thereof via decisions
adopted by the rule forming entities (European Council and/or
Eurogroup);</li>
  <li>The EMU is not recognised by the international community as a
sovereign nation state.</li>
</ul>

<p>By stripping the EMU of its pretences on sovereignty, we are left with a
complex system of rules that apply to all Member States, which specify
their shared responsibility, commitment, and interconnected
liability. For sovereignty to be incorporated in this architecture, a
political sphere needs to be introduced, with the two-fold objective to:
(i) address all of the EMU’s shortcomings as enlisted above, and (ii)
transform the EMU into a republic, operating along federal lines.</p>

<p>In the absence of EMU-level sovereignty, Member States hold a several
and joint responsibility to commit to a standalone set of rules that is
not part of a wider corpus of will-formation. A network of legal
principles, against the backdrop of intergovernmental arrangements for
decision-making, represents an inflexible order that can become subject
to abuse. There are no credible mechanisms for the enforcement of the
common objectives, while any such exercise, given the lack of sufficient
EMU-level legitimacy and accountability, is akin to the annulment of
national popular will.</p>

<p>The notion of “shared sovereignty” is not considered inaccurate due to
semantic or esoteric reasons, but only because its significations
contribute to the conflation between what we currently have—a quasi
[con]federal system—and what we presumably denote by “sovereignty”: a
polity with a single international personality, preferably a republic.</p>

<p><a id="h:d734f44c-ed32-4ff0-87ed-acc6a110065b"></a></p>

<h2>Institutional independence of the European Central Bank</h2>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is the institution of the European Union
tasked with conducting monetary policy. To deliver on its mandate, the
ECB enjoys a very high degree of independence. Though institutional
independence is a core attribute of the division of powers, the ECB’s
position has to be considered in conjunction with the Europe Union’s
peculiar political order.</p>

<p>The rationale underpinning monetary independence is that politicians
should not be in a position to influence monetary affairs, for that
could provide the incentive to introduce short term measures for
boosting economic activity at the expense of longer term
sustainability. The central bank, just like a constitutional court, has
to think about the broader context and the wider ramifications of its
policy, something that politicians may not necessarily be keen on doing
if they are to win an election.</p>

<p>While monetary policy ought to be protected from opportunistic
interference and must have a degree of continuity, the general
perception of politicians as abusive and the concomitant aversion to the
possible fluctuations of democratic conduct, if universalised, will
usher in a robust technocracy. To avoid such extremes, it is of
paramount importance to distinguish between operational independence and
independence from democratic control. The former is a prerequisite to
good governance as well as the optimal, unencumbered conduct of monetary
policy, while the latter is dubious at best.</p>

<p>Though the degree of independence as well as the scope of authority
always need to be proportional to the task, one must also account for
the modality of independence: the <strong>way</strong> in which independence is realised
in a certain state of affairs. In the EU’s brand of supranational
politics, it exhibits certain unique characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>pseudo-permanence:</strong> no given parliament, neither the European nor any
national one, can amend the ECB’s mandate; unanimity among Member
States is required to change a single iota in the Treaties;</li>
  <li><strong>tokenistic accountability:</strong> given that the European Parliament has no
means of initiating the process of altering the ECB’s legal basis, the
democratic accountability of the ECB is effectively reduced to a
communication policy, with the so-called Monetary Dialogue between the
two institutions being nothing more than “dialogue”;</li>
  <li><strong>euro statelessness:</strong> the euro is a currency that belongs to no state,
there is no political union underpinning the Economic and Monetary
Union and, a fortiriori, the ECB has no counter-party European
Treasury with which to coordinate economic policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Couched in those terms, we would contend that the modality of
institutional independence actually makes the ECB mostly independent
from democratic control rather than operationally independent; an
unintended effect of gradualism, of the EU being an incomplete political
organisation. This claim is based on a specific, albeit not
idiosyncratic, understanding of accountability: the obligation of an
unelected institution to render things concrete before the citizens’
representatives and remain subject to the consequences thereof. Since
there exists no European Ministry of Finance to frame the ECB’s conduct
and given that the European Parliament has no full power to act on the
ECB’s briefings, communications, policies, the independence of this
institution seems disproportionate to its power.</p>

<p>A justification for the ECB’s institutional standing can be that its
clear mandate enables it to achieve “output legitimacy”. If it delivers
on its expected objective of price stability it is legitimised by the
result. While plausible, the claims on output legitimacy leave something
to be desired, for they presume the ECB’s mandate to be <strong>unequivocal</strong>,
i.e. that there is only one way of interpreting it and, hence, any one
can be an objective judge. Alas, price stability concerns the medium
term outlook of monetary policy. However, there is no clear definition
of what the “medium term” amounts to. It is ambiguous: it can be 2-5
years or perhaps 5-8. Maybe some other range. Also, how close is “below
but close” to 2% inflation? Does the projected rate also account for it?</p>

<p>Our task is not to provide definitions on the subject, but only to point
to a certain weakness in the argument for output legitimacy. Such
vagueness opens up a sluice gate for the introduction of all sorts of
justifications to any policy. To that end, accountability to
parliamentarians is reduced to a process of “explaining” decisions, so
obscure language can always be employed to obfuscate or beautify the
actual outcomes. The gist is that unelected officials have to make
qualitative decisions and, therefore, another institution should be able
to hold them accountable.</p>

<p>Its mandate’s vagueness notwithstanding, even if the ECB were to
consistently deliver on price stability, that would not be sufficient to
legitimise all of its initiatives, for it clearly acts on issues that do
not pertain to inflation targeting even if they may be treated as
ancillary to that end, such as the decision not to maintain an
accommodative stance vis-à-vis the Greek banking system during the month
of July 2015. There it had to make a judgement call on two seemingly
conflicting objectives: (1) maintain the uniformity of monetary policy,
and (2) abstain from furnishing liquidity to financial institutions that
were expected to become insolvent. While the trade-off may be
understandable, the fact remains that a certain judgement on politics
cannot be evaluated solely by means of referencing a single
macroeconomic indicator.</p>

<p>There is a certain view that a central bank’s institutional independence
should mimic that of a supreme court. Given that both entities are made
up of unelected experts in their fields, this appears to be a sound
proposition. Yet such thinking seems to underestimate the qualitative
differences between a court of law arbitrating on the scope of
legislation, whose decisions tend to have a gradual and progressive
impact on the social fabric, and a central bank with the power to make
an entire economy go boom or bust with relatively little effort
(especially the latter).</p>

<p>It is in the nature of central banking to be the cornerstone of a
financialised system. In the modern world, financialisation and central
banking are inextricably bound up together. A failure to maintain the
money supply will grind a developed economy to the ground, just as a
prolonged period of disinflation or outright deflation will severely
damage economic activity while making nominal debt burdens heavier. In
other words, a central bank is powerful, especially if it rules over a
significantly large economy.</p>

<p>As concerns the reach of monetary policy, one may take Quantitative
Easing as a case in point: a policy instrument with which the central
bank shapes interest rates throughout the yield curve by virtue of
buying assets in the secondary market. This effectively represents the
capacity to redistribute resources across the economy. If the central
bank can achieve the same or similar results as those of an elected
government’s fiscal and social policy, then it follows that it must also
be subject to strict democratic control: citizens have to ultimately be
able to review, reject or approve of effective wealth transfers.</p>

<p>A central bank needs to be closely monitored, be subject to thorough
scrutiny, and be held fully accountable for its decisions precisely
because its day-to-day operations can change the material conditions of
entire classes of economic actors. That is more so for the European
Central Bank which finds itself in an institutional framework that
remains under construction. With few credible mechanisms for placing a
check on the monetary function, policy makers should not remain
satisfied with narratives on the sufficiency of output legitimacy or
with misleading comparisons between a central bank and a court of
law. Better institutional arrangements and accountability structures are
needed, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>concerted action:</strong> just as with the Bank of England, make the rate of
inflation an <strong>annual target</strong> placed in the hands of the European Finance
Minister, who will also control the European Treasury and, hence, be
responsible for formulating the economic policy of the supranational
level;</li>
  <li><strong>dual mandate:</strong> like the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States,
the ECB has to pursue price stability <strong>and</strong> full employment, with no
priority given to any one of them—it is preposterous to witness record
levels of unemployment and the central bank do nothing about it
(besides, an increase in jobs and, thus, in consumer spending would
move the euro area away from disinflationary or deflationary
territory);</li>
  <li><strong>full transparency:</strong> ensure that records of all General and Executive
Council meetings are kept, and that they are available to Members of
the European Parliament within the context of the Monetary Dialogue,
following a formal request from the Economic and Monetary Affairs
committee;</li>
  <li><strong>legislative control:</strong> provide the co-legislative institutions of the
European Parliament and the Council of the EU with the right to
jointly propose an amendment to the legal basis of the ECB, subject to
approval by the European Administration, or vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transnational democracy</h2>

<p>In this third and final part of the book we delve into political theory,
to examine such notions as “decentralisation” and “sovereignty”, for the
sake of adapting them to the reality of the European Union. Our thesis
is that the European Union is an experiment in transnational
democracy. By that we mean that it is a new way of doing politics in
Europe, one that contrasts with the historical paradigm of foreign
policy (and war) between European nation states.</p>

<p>The EU is often presented in a negative light, sometimes correctly due
to its own flaws and limitations. Its problems are amplified by such
shocks as the euro crisis or, more recently, the migrant and refugee
crisis. What these phenomena do is put the EU architecture to the test,
exposing the areas where it clearly falls short of meeting its own
principles and fulfilling its objectives.</p>

<p>Inadequacy and incompleteness do indeed characterise much of the
European Union. Yet one ought to bear in mind the nature of European
integration as a process. The shortcomings of the existing order should
not be the source of negativity and ultimately nihilism, while any
shortcomings cannot be blithely attributed to “Brussels” as such, for
they often derive from the conflicts of national agendas within
intergovernmental entities. It is of paramount importance to keep sight
of the broader picture. Each crisis, every instance of friction, does
indeed pose a challenge, revealing a certain constraint on collective
action. What this system does offer though should not be underestimated
nor be taken for granted, while calls for abolishing the EU or parts
thereof should be judged on the basis of their merit as realisable and
credible alternatives, not be offered support solely as a reaction to
the EU’s actual problems.</p>

<p>Criticism of the EU is not a bad thing. Still, one ought to be eclectic
and fair, which probably is more demanding than pursuing the politics of
negation. An engaged and constructive spirit would ultimately help
improve daily life in the EU. One also has to have a historical
perspective, to appreciate where Europe was in the first half of the
20th century or in centuries past, and where it now stands. Despite all
its frailties, European integration has been mostly positive, something
worth having and striving to improve, rather than something to be
abolished.</p>

<p>What the political unification of Europe can do is prepare European
nations for the global challenges of the 21st century. A united Europe
is one that can have an impact on international trade, in global
security, and perhaps most importantly, in the protection of the
environment and the necessary transition to ecological—maybe more
circular—forms of production and consumption. If the European continent
were to continue as a patchwork of squabbling nation states, it would
have remained fragile, exposed to external shocks, and could have
eventually become a peripheral player in global politics.</p>

<p>While such considerations have their value, one should not rely entirely
on the international or external challenges facing European
nations. European integration cannot be understood as a mere reaction to
an exogenous impetus, however defined. The political unification of
Europe is something more than a coalition of interests for influencing
the international order. A European polity is not a cartel of sorts, nor
should it be cast in that light. There actually are endogenous reasons
for pursuing European integration.</p>

<p>Firstly, this is a means of guaranteeing inter-state peace. The history
of Europe has been one of perpetual conflict between its various
nations, including those that currently are Member States of the
European Union. No such thing can be claimed about those very same
nations since the formal introduction of the European Communities.</p>

<p>Secondly, a Europe divided along national lines is not a good place to
do business in a globalising world. It makes little practical sense to
maintain all sorts of barriers to the movement of goods, persons,
services, and capital while technological innovation as well as a
greater awareness of international politics are rapidly making our world
a more self-conscious whole.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the nation state arguably is a European invention. Though its
underlying nationalism, understood as the traditional sentiment of being
pro-nation-state, has achieved certain normative ends, this form of
political organisation has also been the source of suffering on a
monumental scale. Two World Wars can, to an extent, be attributed to the
tensions between conflicting nationalisms. If bringing ideas to the
world entails a certain responsibility, then perhaps it can be expected
from Europeans to think of ways to correct the inherent flaws of the
nationalist conception of statehood. A transnational
democracy—understood as <strong>transnational</strong> and not as a European
nationalism—can be that step forward.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, it is important to adopt a synthetic view of the
forces that influence the European integration process. Though
differences of opinion may arise as to which set of factors is most
important to the political unification of Europe, the fact remains that
one has to account for both the internal and external dimensions of the
broader issue. Maybe there will be instances of integration that are
driven by exogenous events, while others are pursued for endogenous
reasons. Whatever the case, Europe’s experiment in transnational
democracy, if proven successful, can provide a template for doing
politics in an increasingly interconnected global order.</p>

<p><a id="h:f3df06d1-c38e-4277-8ca6-d5b5b3561896"></a></p>

<h2>Democracy as decentralised power</h2>

<p>If we think of politics as the <strong>instituted distribution of power</strong> then
democracy will have to be conceived as a system of decentralised
power. We may compare and contrast this to other systems such as
<strong>autocracy</strong> where power is in the hands of a single ruler, <strong>oligarchy</strong> where
it is in the hands of few people, <strong>aristocracy</strong> where it is held by a
culturally-defined elite, <strong>technocracy</strong> where power is exercised by policy
experts, <strong>ochlocracy</strong> where the mob reigns supreme, and so on.</p>

<p>In effect, modern republics do interpret democracy as a decentralisation
of sorts. We may infer thus from the application of the principle of the
division of powers. Different entities are tasked with pursuing the
distinct functions of the state. The executive is separated from the
legislative, which is different from the judiciary, which is distinct
from the monetary, and so on. What the separation of powers does is to
introduce a <strong>horizontal</strong> form of decentralisation among the functions of
an otherwise uniform state. The separation of the state’s powers does
not, in and of itself, guarantee the decentralised distribution of
authority. It does however place constraints on the state with the
objective to hamper any attempt at the accumulation of power in the
hands of some of those who may happen to exercise it.</p>

<p>In a representative democracy, we may add that bottom-up legitimation is
connatural with decentralisation. By that we mean that the process by
which a relatively smaller collection of people gets to decide on behalf
of a larger population starts from the broadest social group possible:
the demos at-large. Representatives come from the body politic, decide
on its behalf and for its well-being, yet they never assume the role of
the demos as the final decider, for that would no longer qualify them as
<strong>representatives</strong>. Ultimate authority rests in the demos. It is never
forfeited nor transferred to a ruling elite. It is only <strong>delegated</strong> to
smaller groups of people and only within a certain legal framework that,
among others, guarantees the continuity of democratic rule.</p>

<p>Such bottom-up legitimation indicates a <strong>vertical</strong> form of
decentralisation. Those who get to exercise power—the representatives of
the demos—are not capable of depriving the demos from its legitimation
function. They are designated as representatives because of—and thanks
to—the decisions of the citizens. Further, and what the custom of
periodic elections introduces, is that delegates cannot permanently
deviate from their voters’ demands or concerns, for that would result in
their removal from office.</p>

<p>The bane of a modern republic is the centralisation of authority, be it
in its vertical or horizontal form. Our notion of decentralisation has
been inferred from the proposition that politics is the instituted
distribution of power. Attention should be given to the term
“instituted”. This connotes a purpose, an intention, a social-cultural
process that may be codified in law. We do not think of power as some
natural phenomenon, for that would not be politics. The state of nature
or the “law of the jungle” is the absence of politics. Instances of
revolution or war are a form of cultural institution, where a given
group seeks to change the established order in accordance with its own
conception of political order. Such occasions may disrupt the stability
of the state or states involved, yet their ultimate objective is to
introduce a new type of stability within which social peace may be
achieved. This is not to suggest that they are necessarily right or
wrong. One cannot make definitive judgements in the abstract. It only is
to claim that the disruption of a certain establishment aims at creating
another status quo rather than at perpetual strife.</p>

<p>Modern republics are constituted as such. The constitution is the
state’s primary law. It is a legal corpus that establishes a given set
of parameters for the realisation of practical morality, while setting
out the modal features of the distribution of power. The word
“constitution” also means “composition”. The state’s primary law, apart
from being its legal cornerstone, is also a purposeful organisation of
its inner structure.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, a republic is not necessarily democratic. It is a
state operating in accordance with the rule of law whose raison d’être
is to promote and to preserve the common good, the <strong>res publica</strong>. The
interpretation of what may the common good be will determine the quality
of the state. In a democracy the res publica can only be conceived in
relation to the demos, its well-being, its capacity to maintain its
legitimation function. From this perspective, we may posit that the res
publica is good inasmuch as it is enjoyed by all, and common so long as
it is good (since the good qua good has to be universalisable).</p>

<p>Democracy is the system for conceiving the common good as a function of
the decentralised distribution of power. Democracy is not the “rule of
the many”. Though decisions may typically be adopted in accordance with
a majority vote, their qualitative features must always comply with a
certain corpus of rules that guarantee the application of practical
morality. The notion of “majority rules” if applied without any
reference to a framework of rules can only be a form of actual or
potential tyranny: the rule of the mob, or the rule of a dominant group
over the rest of society.</p>

<p>If a democratic system degenerates to the point where power becomes
abusive or concentrated in a certain person or group thereof, then the
institution of decentralisation is abolished or inwardly corrupted. A
democracy is not instituted once by means of introducing a
constitution. Decentralisation is continuous, exercised and understood
as such through the conduct of day-to-day politics. No legal document
can, in and of itself, guarantee the instituted decentralisation of
power. What rules do is frame the conduct of individuals and groups
within the polity. It is for this reason that democracy cannot just be
exogenously imposed on any given people, but rather has to emanate
from—or be anchored in—their own cultural will.</p>

<h2>Democratic sovereignty</h2>

<p>By “sovereignty” we refer to the ultimate authority within a given
polity. During the Middle Ages the sovereign was a person, typically the
monarch. With the advent of the modern nation state, the sovereign
became an impersonal agency: the nation. The nation can be an elusive
entity. At first, it entails no definitive bond between the people that
make it up. Secondly, it is interpreted as atemporal, which implies that
whatever common bond may exist, it is not only between the generations
in existence. By that we mean that a nation is not equivalent to the
actual citizens or people of a given state, as it also encompasses all
possible citizens or people of the state. There ostensibly is no
finality to the nation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding some of the mysticism involved in defining the nation,
international relations are very much dependent on this concept. No
wonder they are inter-<strong>national</strong>. However, the contemporary international
order does adopt a prosaic view of nationhood, stripping it of its early
modern pretences on temporal transcendence. A nation qua sovereign can
only be a nation state. This is a reflection of the actualised right of
peoples to self-determination. Nation states transcend the life span of
any given generation of their people only for as long as that is deemed
necessary, and only by means of convention. A stateless nation may
indeed be talked about as a nation, but it is never considered
sovereign.</p>

<p>Sovereignty, or else self-determination realised as
state-formation-state-institution, means that the state legitimised by
its people, and recognised as such by the international community, can
pursue its own policies without intervention from other states. This is
a centuries-old conception of statehood that is often termed
“Westphalian” in reference to the Peace Treaty of Westphalia (1648
C.E.). The Westphalian tenets of statehood imply the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Territoriality:</strong> every state must have a clearly defined territory
over which its sovereignty may be made manifest and be applicable;</li>
  <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> every state continues to exist as a state even if its
people may change or its legal order undergoes a period of crisis;</li>
  <li><strong>Independence:</strong> the capacity for self-determination that, when applied
globally, entails the principle of non-intervention in the internal
affairs of another state;</li>
  <li><strong>Equality:</strong> every state is equal to any other state in its capacity as
a state;</li>
  <li><strong>Uniformity:</strong> the state is understood as the primary actor of
diplomatic affairs in the international order and is treated as a
single personality;</li>
  <li><strong>Nationhood:</strong> the identification of the state with a given
culturally-defined people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps a more precise concept for describing this type of sovereignty
is “national sovereignty”, which is in terms of statehood equivalent to
“nation state sovereignty”. From a democratic perspective, there is
nothing intrinsic to national sovereignty which guarantees the normative
ends of the decentralised distribution of power. The “national will” or
the “national interest” can be—and has been—evoked by all sorts of
abusers of powers as a means of justifying their machinations. Various
states in the international community are indeed recognised as sovereign
nations even though they do not have strong, adequate, or any
institutions in place to preserve the decentralisation of authority. As
such, a normative theory of statehood cannot remain limited to the
understanding of sovereignty as national sovereignty, unless it attaches
to it its own significations to the point where it has nothing in common
with the prevailing definition.</p>

<p>While it may be useful and perhaps tactically prudent to interpret
nationhood in a way that it incorporates democratic principles, it
generally is preferable to coin new terms for the sake of avoiding
confusion. If a certain notion can be both democracy and its opposite,
then it does not really help us understand what a certain proposition’s
actual meaning may be. One shrewd enough can use such polysemy to their
advantage or, conversely, one sloppy enough may inadvertently obfuscate
some of the issues involved.</p>

<p>We sometimes come across the phrase “popular sovereignty”, while there
is a certain alter-establishment tendency to interpret “populism” as a
positive term that indicates the capacity of the people to be
sovereign. These views are interesting and fecund, yet they are
insufficient to a democracy.</p>

<p>Their first limitation is that they place a disproportionate emphasis on
the internal aspects of sovereign authority. This forces them to
downplay the importance of the essence of the Westphalian state:
non-interference from other states. A sovereign people without a strong
state that has an equal standing in the global order, will always be
exposed to external threats or to pressures that may undermine its
conventions. Sovereignty of such a sort would be a <strong>sovereignty manqué</strong>.</p>

<p>The second tension in this line of over-evaluating the populace, is that
it cannot easily fit with the vertical dimension of political
organisation, especially for more complex formations of state, such as a
federal system. If it is only or primarily the people who are sovereign,
then the legal-institutional order of the state will have to be very
weak so as not to impede or limit the popular will. A near-obsolete
framework of rules can eventually be the cause of disorder, either due
to the inability of the system to place sufficient constitutional checks
on the distribution and exercise of power, or because the popular
sovereign will descend into an ochlocratic tyrant.</p>

<p>Democracy is a compound term made up of the words “demos” and
“kratos”. The former signifies the body of citizens, those who
participate in the commons. The latter means state, understood as an
interweaving web of laws, institutions, and convention-based
intersubjective relations. As was considered in the previous chapter,
democracy is not the “rule of the many”. It is the instituted
decentralisation of power.</p>

<p>For sovereignty to entail democracy, we need to adopt an eclectic and
synthetic approach which will isolate and indeed combine the positive
elements from the seemingly polar views of [nation] state sovereignty
and popular sovereignty. We may rework these into a <strong>democratic
sovereignty</strong>, which will stand for the virtuous cycle of legitimation and
accountability between the demos and the kratos, the citizens and their
state.</p>

<p>The feedback loop of democratic sovereignty can be understood in light
of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within a given political tradition (a civic nation), the body politic
proceeds to delegate its authority to various groups of
decision-makers. This typically occurs through periodic elections.</li>
  <li>In such a national tradition, the body of citizens does not act in a
legal-institutional vacuum. There are rules in place which guarantee
the horizontal and vertical decentralisation of power.</li>
  <li>The political representatives are bestowed with the authority to take
decisions on behalf—and in the interest—of the demos. Among the
decisions are the promulgation of laws, the distribution of scarce
resources, the qualitative features of cultural experience, the
conduct of environmental policy, and so on. These set precedents for
future processes of legitimation.</li>
  <li>The judiciary operates in parallel as an arbiter of the applicability
of the laws. Its jurisprudence has an impact on the polity, for it
sets parameters within which certain policy initiatives may be
realised.</li>
  <li>The judiciary does not decide arbitrarily. It accounts for the
prevailing conditions, the legal order, and its jurisprudential
traditions to deliver rulings that are in line with practical
necessity and the state’s primary law. A judiciary that would seek to
become a tyrant on the rest of the state would be overruled by means
of a constitutional reform, or the state would implode.</li>
  <li>A constitutional reform will, at some point involve the body of
citizens, either directly via a referendum, or indirectly, via their
representatives.</li>
  <li>The representatives cannot permanently deviate from their voters’
concerns, for that may eventually impact their status as
representatives.</li>
  <li>The citizens of a state are not defined independently of the state’s
legal-institutional framework. It is a certain set of legal provisions
that may make one a citizen of the state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the scope of democracy, state and citizens cannot be seen as
separate. National sovereignty alone implies a distorted version of the
common good. Popular sovereignty in its own capacity entails a very weak
institutional framework that may expose the state to external threats or
to internal self-destructive propensities for injustice. Whereas the
combination of these two means that the culturally-historically defined
demos will operate within a certain milieu of laws, institutions, and
statehood to realise the res publica as practical morality that is
indeed common to all and universally good.</p>

<h2>Federalism as state-level decentralisation</h2>

<p>Federalism is the ideology of vertical decentralisation among state
structures. A federal system is one where there are different levels of
government, each deciding on policies that have varying degrees of
application. In European law this is also known as the <strong>principle of
subsidiarity</strong>, where the distribution of authority is proportional to the
scope of the policies affecting a given group of citizens. Federalism’s
main idea is that power should be as close to the local level as
possible, and should only be directed toward the federal level if
locality-based decisions would be understood as insufficient for the
stated objective.</p>

<p>In this regard, federalism is a specific brand of democratic
organisation, best suited to a largely diverse demos. Though democracy
does entail the decentralisation of authority, this quality alone is not
sufficient for guaranteeing decentralisation in a polity that needs to
preserve its inner instituted heterogeneity. If the diversity of the
demos is to be guaranteed through state structures all while remaining
an organic whole, a vertical dimension of constitutional
decentralisation needs to be introduced so as to prevent dominant states
within the demos from imposing their will on less influential states.</p>

<p>Federalism should not be confused with decentralised government,
i.e. with regions within a unitary state having a high degree of
autonomy. The latter may not have the kind of constitutional checks
necessary for maintaining that vertical separation between the central
government and the regions, whereas a federal system will typically have
primary law provisions for maintaining the necessary discreteness
between the federal and the state levels as well as among the
constitutive states themselves.</p>

<p>Though it may seem a contradiction of terms to refer to a federal system
as a state, the fact is that, as seen from the international
perspective, a sovereign federation is but a nation state. By that we
mean that a federation is understood as a single sovereign nation, one
that has a unified international personality, manifesting in a uniform
representation in all international fora, with the United Nations being
the most notable among them.</p>

<p>To avoid the confusion that derives from the polysemy of the term
“state”, and in order to account for the international dimension of a
polity, we may refer to a federal system as a <strong>composite nation state</strong>. A
composite nation state consists of other states, however these have no
international standing as nation states but only as higher-level
administrative units within a nation state. For example, when we refer
to the United States of America we think of the American nation; when
alluding to the Russian Federation we have in mind the Russian
nation. Though these are federations, they both have a single
international personality as nation states, which in terms of UN
representation also manifests in a single seat (and veto power inside
the security council).</p>

<p>It is intuitive to think of nations as organic wholes: groups of people
who, through their history and culture have forged a common bond between
them. What is less clear though is whether these communities are bound
together by something more than their shared imaginary, i.e. their
common beliefs, norms, traditions, cultural narratives, and so
on. Though it is not pertinent to this book to delve into the
intricacies of nationhood, we will posit the civic conception as the
most plausible one. This is the view by which a nation is a people
self-determined in accordance with their political affiliation, values,
historical experiences etc., not their ethnicity, kinship, or race.</p>

<p>If the civic nation is, in effect, a form of “social contract”, then we
can envisage a federal system that is made up of different historical
nations, provided they agree on a common basis for coexistence: a
constitutional agreement. The European Union could be such a case. There
would still be republics like those of France and Germany, but they
would forfeit their international standing as nation states,
transferring it to a new nation state, the federal republic of the
European Union (whether its name changes is irrelevant—what matters is
the political system, since a name can be preserved for the sake of
continuity). These historical nations would not cease to exist as
nations. There would still be France and Germany as constitutive states
of the federation, though they would no longer stand as <strong>nation
states</strong>. By that we mean that they would forgo the international status
of statehood that is commensurate with their nationhood. That would be
reserved for the European Union at-large.</p>

<p>The European nation would be a “nation of nations”. We can approximate
such a concept by thinking of an otherwise reluctant EU Member State:
the United Kingdom. The UK has England, Scotland, Wales, Northern
Ireland. These peoples share a common bond which is present in their
state structures, and they respect it for as long as they are
together. Despite having many nations within its borders, the UK has a
single international personality as a nation state, with a seat in the
United Nations (where they also have a veto power inside the security
council). Still their uniformity on the stage of international politics
does not prevent them from expressing their national pluralism. We do
witness it, for instance, in various sports such as their favourite
game: football. There is the English national team, which differs from
the Scottish, the Welsh, the Northern Irish.</p>

<p>A constituted European demos, a European body politic as the
constitutional subject of a European federal republic, will have to be a
largely diverse one, respectful of its constitutive historical
nations. For it to be understood as a demos of a certain nation state,
that polity would have to guarantee a vertical form of state-level
decentralisation, otherwise larger nations within the European demos
could exercise an effective hegemony over smaller ones. A federal system
is decentralisation among state structures. It aims to complement and
enhance the horizontal decentralisation among the polity’s state
functions, while a federal system is the only means by which there can
be a unified European demos which would indeed remain united in its
diversity.</p>

<h2>Europe’s sovereignty mismatch</h2>

<p>The European Union has two entities capable of forming the rules that
fall within their competences. The one is the institution of the
European Council, while the other is the Eurogroup, a partially informal
body that brings together the finance ministers of all Member States
whose currency is the euro. Both are intergovernmental, meaning that
they stand as fora where the national governments are represented and
where their collective will is formed. Under normal circumstances, the
Eurogroup would not be placed on an equal footing with the European
Council, however the euro crisis and the concatenation of events leading
to the adoption of extraordinary measures for addressing the financial
shock has made this entity a key player in European politics.</p>

<p>The democratic quality of these rule forming entities could be
improved. Though measures to increase their transparency would be
welcome, a certain change in their structures is necessary. Their
shortcomings are ones of design, pertaining to the indirectness of their
legitimacy and accountability as bodies. While each representative is
typically legitimised by—and is answerable to—their national electorate,
the <strong>collection</strong> of nationally legitimised officials is not commensurate
with system-wide legitimacy and accountability. This is made manifest in
the fact that the rules formed concern the Union (or the euro area)
<strong>at-large</strong>, while the democratic loop of legitimacy and accountability
remains confined to national borders.</p>

<p>Democratic procedures at the national level only concern the political
leader of that state, yet it is clear that said leader was not alone in
adopting the decision for forming a certain supranational rule. The
decision was collective, yet the collective <strong>as such</strong> is answerable to no
corresponding collective of European citizens or representatives
thereof. Put simply, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President François Holland may be pivotal in shaping a certain decision
at the European Council, yet they only have to answer to their own
voters, Germans and French respectively, even though their influence may
effectively extend beyond Germany and France.</p>

<p>Fragmentation along national lines may be perceived as positive, as it
seems that multiple checks are placed on supranational authority. While
plausible, that is analytically incorrect, for the multitude of checks
is not placed on the wholeness of such power, but only on its instances
as appearing at the national level. Still, it may be argued that the
full area of the system necessarily covers all of its parts, those being
each of the Member States. Since each of these parts is a nation state
operating as a democracy, then it is to be inferred that all the parts
are placing a check on supranational authority. Such line of thinking
would fail to treat things in terms of their interoperation, remaining
trapped in a mindset of aggregation.</p>

<p>The distinction between aggregation and interoperation is important for
three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the parts of the system, the Member States, always retain their
status as parts, even though they may adopt joint decisions, and they
always work together within the framework of European law which,
among others, determines the modal features of their interoperations,
with the peculiarities of the European Council and the Eurogroup
being among them;</li>
  <li>if we were to think that several democracies bundled together produce
a greater democracy, then the EU would have to qualify as a democracy
<strong>par excellence</strong>; an inference that would not factor in the inter-state
power relations that may be formed depending on the prevailing
conditions or the subject at hand and how these may produce states of
affairs that were not demanded by any unified body of citizens;</li>
  <li>the view that the EU is the sum of its parts—a greater
democracy—misses the key attribute of national democracy, which is
its relative <strong>directness</strong>; whereas the aggregation of democracies,
within the context of intergovernmental negotiations, is indirect at
best, with such indirectness rendering intergovernmentalism
normatively inferior to the customs and procedures that apply to the
national level.</li>
</ol>

<p>Adding to the above, we need to account for sovereignty in its
democratic version, as the interplay between state and popular
sovereignty, and then use that as a criterion for evaluating the quality
of supranational rule formation. A democratically sovereign state is one
where there exists a virtuous cycle between legitimacy and
accountability. The citizens legitimise the state’s structures, while
the state adopts decisions for the citizens in line with the promotion
of the common good, always remaining answerable to them, and always
bound by the state’s legal order.</p>

<p>The EU’s sovereignty mismatch is discernible in the lack of overlap
between the scope of European rule formation and that of a
constitutionally non-existent European demos. Though there is European
citizenship, it does not have a constitutional status, one which would
substantiate a European demos as the subject performing the function of
legitimising each of the rule forming entities <strong>as a body</strong>, as well as
holding each of them accountable <strong>as a whole</strong>.</p>

<p>To address this issue, two changes are necessary in line with embedding
democratic sovereignty: (1) a European demos needs to be made the
constitutional subject of the European Union, and (2) the rule forming
entities need to become akin to national governments in both their
legitimacy and accountability. This would indeed make supranational
legitimacy and accountability at least equal in value to those existing
at the national level, solidifying the position of the EU as a
<strong>successful</strong> experiment in transnational democracy, one that would
manifest as a federal republic of a nation of nations.</p>
