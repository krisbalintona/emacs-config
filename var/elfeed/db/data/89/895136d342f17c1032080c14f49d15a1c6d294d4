         <p>In this video blog I do something different than what has been the norm
lately: I just to talk about Emacs rather than demonstrate some of its
cool functionalities.</p>

<p>My thesis is that Emacs has a strong documentation culture, which
extends to the entire experience with this tool.</p>

<p>I also discuss how Emacs is the vivid realisation of the GNU telos,
which is codified in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">the four
freedoms</a>.  Your day-to-day
usage of Emacs will most likely cover—or directly benefit from—all of
them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to use the software as you wish;</li>
  <li>to study its source and to modify it;</li>
  <li>to share the original;</li>
  <li>to share your changes to the original.</li>
</ul>

<p>Combined with its documentation culture, Emacs is a microcosm of the GNU
project’s vision for software freedom.</p>

<p>While not related to this video blog, here is my dotemacs, in case you
want to exercise some of that freedom:
