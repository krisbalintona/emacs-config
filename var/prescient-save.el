Because these history's ideas are still relevant. For example, Bacon's idols are inspired by human tendencies which is the same today as it was in his time. Machiavelli similarly called on his observations of human behavior and applied it to politics. Popper's ideas are much more intricate and involved than Bacon's because Popper stands on the shoulders of thinkers throughout the three centuries that came after Bacon. Nevertheless, we still see strands of thought that find roots in Renaissance thinkers like Bacon. One of Popper's discussion is that on the \"save \" of truth. Rather than adopt a paradigm in which one considers knowledge to be correct after experimentation and hypothesizing, something that leverages the empirical grounds and rational argumentation that Bacon and Machiavelli espoused, we should consider truth to be transitory, only useful until it is proven false. Truth is elusive since we even with an infinite number of positive cases we can never deduce the correctness of a theory. This view that human knowledge can never confirm its own veracity is something that Sanches gets at, although in a less rigorous sense, and shows how ideas are ideas and thus are still universally applicable across different contexts, including time." 0.14795194751209378 "flyspell-correct-interface" 0.7316383546629995 "134  ;;;;; All-the-icons-ivy-rich" 0.884100203995605 "outshine-faces" 0.7142623049177186 "system-wide-package-groups.org" 0.14862742227925688 "mechanism" 0.21345747714456828 "con" 0.20838796743703716 "(zett) Innovation and discovery begin in places far removed from where they become tangible" 0.06284066974597925 "178  ** First draft" 0.3768849871581085 "helpful-symbol" 1.7320337559970946 "base-config.org" 0.611933836786926 "configs/second-brain.org:266:** Org-ref" 0.11564414984586797 "completion-frameworks.org" 1.9654070875400533 "" 0.18468953526469642 "(lit, class) POBS0910 Seventh Class" 0.07593567038626761 "Clean All" 0.7744298981215677 "üñã üñá 1997 Crosby, Alfred W.
