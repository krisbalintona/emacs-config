This is why Machiavelli is such a keystone historically. His model for accepting reality and making judgments on what is rather than what should be is completely novel. This he had gained the reputation as the \"teacher of evil\" (cite:mansfieldNiccoloMachiavelliBiography). This convergence toward the idea of \"amoral necessity,\" that which is immoral can be become justified if \"the end justifies the means,\" is why historians see Machiavelli as the founder of modern science, \"a discipline based on the actual state of the world as opposed to how the world might be in utopias such as the Republic of Plato (428/27–348/47 BC) or the City of God of Saint Augustine (354–430)\" (cite:mansfieldNiccoloMachiavelliBiography)." 0.12504016890692154 "configs/completion-frameworks.org:911:    (add-to-list 'consult-annotate-alist" 0.18258269131405633 "LaTeX-length-list" 0.8931152470257435 "consult" 0.18702442918130358 "ivy-mode" 0.18758719075356428 "configs/base-config.org:705:** Unpackaged.el" 0.1986072836794012 "consult-multi-occur" 0.1998043113084501 "projectile-multi-occur" 0.20040552789212648 "org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift" 0.20100855355278485 "origin/master" 0.4062673955966812 "disable-mouse-global-mode" 0.4099458507843067 "configs/buffer-management.org:245:    \"hw\" '(hydra:windows-and-font-size/body :which-key \"Augment window settings\")" 0.20589854228901325 "(zett) Machiavelli was an influence on Bacon just like any other thinker" 0.2065180965787495 "execute-extended-command" 0.747280900371748 "(zett) The Quantification Revolution" 0.20776280353472606 "(zett) Europe extended the Greek Miracle" 0.20838796743703716 "(zett) The Ancient Greeks were the first to believe humans could codify and understand the universe" 1.0785800461232298 "􀀓  How quantification started becoming important to the Europeans" 0.2109074910864818 "(bib_notes) crosbyMeasureRealityQuantification: The Measure of Reality: Quantification and Western Society" 0.2115421174387982 "configs/completion-frameworks.org:970:      \"ff\" 'helm-find-files" 0.22464340895049556 " 898  ** Consult.el" 0.5462295599724283 "consult-recent-file" 0.4540368610150299 "electric-quote-mode" 0.4879859443591957 "~/main-emacs/elisp/better-defaults-rcp.el" 0.7987481804660974 "debug-emacs" 0.6650075075905731 "config.org" 0.6670085331901435 "~/main-emacs/elisp/themes-rcp.el" 0.7891875367865512 "~/main-emacs/elisp/faces-rcp.el" 0.2706411720577021 "  (if (daemonp) ; Set fonts based on if daemon or not
