Legalism is not an extended personal philosophy like Confucianism is and so it provides no moral framework for individuals. Its principles apply to governance which leaves behind no instruction for how individuals should behave, barring the edicts of law. In combination with the fact that a Legalist government does not treat human beings as things that should be supported but, rather, weakened (198), the individual is left to suffer and have no imperative or grounding aside from the one of the state.􋃇" 89 "liPoetryDiplomacyZuozhuan2014 Poetry and Diplomacy in the Zuozhuan                                                                                                                                    #journal_a#journal_article" 76 "RELS0120                                                                                                                                                                                                        " 44 "org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift" 93 "*helpful function: ace-link--org-collect*􀀁" 1 "(org-id-get)" 2 "textcquote" 85 "configs/qol-packages.org:417:          (save-excursion" 33 "elisp/completion-ivy-rcp.el:201:    \"fr\" '(counsel-recentf :which-key \"Recent files\")" 39 "autocite" 83 "          (save-excursion􃆤" 32 "\\textcquote[]{debarySourcesChineseTradition1999}{

It can easily be exploited in desperate conditions, collapsing the efficacy of government. This may have been apparent to the disciples of Xunzi, a Confucian, who were more convinced by Legalist thought than Confucian thought (160).

Legalism is not an extended personal philosophy like Confucianism is and so it provides no moral framework for individuals. Its principles apply to governance which leaves behind no instruction for how individuals should behave, barring the edicts of law. In combination with the fact that a Legalist government does not treat human beings as things that should be supported but, rather, weakened (198), the individual is left to suffer and have no imperative or grounding aside from the one of the state.􋃇" 0.623935727831958 "projectile-find-tag" 0.19157422239125255 "customize" 0.405658909978139 "org-roam-teardown" 0.8688034262244321 "org-roam-version" 0.20838796743703716 "org-roam-db-sync" 0.6876281390685931 "This is a headline and should be a node?                                                                                                                                                              #tag #firs#tag #first #person" 0.46718466475457304 "init.el" 0.24144036635199037 "wordnut-search" 0.051260074022439005 "utilize" 0.5055928652970137 "ENGL0930                                                                                                                                                                                                        " 1.0618670882136563 "consult-preview-mode" 0.095276339085964 "Monetize yourself" 0.3789100589437935 "Daoists" 0.7792882711929549 "worthwhile" 0.38580263080841853 "Contently" 0.3999661937018806 "Be your genuine self                                                                                                                                                                                  #refine   #refine" 0.3928205821550279 "* Being a better person􀎧" 0.39518815438796623 "aspects" 0.39876629512077494 "access" 0.3975699962354126 "refine" 1.7208760441851074 "supported" 0.46760059256584285 "memory" 0.43376450487636337 "** Studying and learning􀙪" 0.43769192634917653 "Spaced repetition                                                                                                                                                                                     #refine   #refine" 0.4403299430379167 "information" 0.4416549077612003 "qualities" 0.4483397746718278 "org-roam-mode" 0.5338556279726977 "~/.config/systemd/" 0.05275238705294368 "~/.config/systemd/user/" 0.05291112041418624 "~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants/" 0.05307033140841148 "emacs.service" 0.05331155030635739 "􀁦~/main-emacs/init.el" 0.23268859213832976 "Mar232021-152749.org" 0.535294682013981 "Nov302020-223130.org" 0.5599710231774805 "Nov302020-230421.org" 0.5701571885437869 "􀁢init.el" 0.07237953139431608 "straight-watcher-start" 0.06010805238919532 "disagreement" 0.6054683389900478 " did not have this unconditional faith and sought Legalist views as being better methods for ruling" 0.6072902096189046 "hampering" 0.6109504135464614 "system" 0.6127887798861198 "Legalist thinkers reasoned that ruling by demonstrating virtuosity is inefficient or an unattainable ideal or, at the very least, is not realistic in many circumstances.

It can easily be exploited in desperate conditions, collapsing the efficacy of government. This may have been apparent to the disciples of Xunzi, a Confucian, who were more convinced by Legalist thought than Confucian thought (160).

What the Chinese government would say is that Tibet has been an integral part of China. And its patterns are no different from Chinese people. And they will point to areas in history where Tibet was under Chinese rule. Tibetans will point to sizable pits of their history where they ran their own affairs. What certainly happened was that after the Chinese Revolution, the Chinese government in Beijing, decided that Tibet was one of their objectives to reincorporate into the People's Republic of China. And so they invaded and they've kept held of it ever since. And what they've got out of it, as well as what they would call, you know, territorial integrity, sort of knock splitting trainer up, what they also get out of it is that it's the roof of the world that it's a plateau that overlooks neighboring countries, particularly India, which is another sort of powerful neighbor. It's got vast quantities of mineral resources. So many different precious metals, gold, lithium, molybdenum and then it's also got water resources, the glaciers in the Himalayas inside Tibet, they flow into several of key rivers in Asia, which run all the way to say Vietnam or deep into India. And those rivers depended on by somewhere between 1 and 2 billion people every day for drinking and other uses. But it's also useful source of say hydro power to power Chinese cities, over the East. So those are some of the key reasons why they would be keen to keep hold of Tibet.
