The crucial point for Chuang-tzŭ is that words have no fixed meanings except in the artificial conditions of intellectual debate, in which one may as well accept the opponent’s definitions, since they are no more or less arbitrary than any others. (cite:grahamChuangtzuInnerChapters2001 28)

This is distinct from other traditions which presuppose the universe as intelligible. Zhuangzi’s beliefs arise from many pragmatic observations.
