You can view your /tasks/ and /projects/ (which can be further separated into /categories/) in either a column or list view (try it out!).􄜮" 0.1998043113084501 "Your Zettelkasten should be made for why you use it                                                                                                                                                   #refine   #refine" 0.07708502894966421 "flycheck-clear" 0.11188462463866453 "Clean All" 0.4055035157633939 "flycheck-textlint-plugin-alist" 0.3691288930118763 "~/Documents/org-database/latex/rels0120-paper_1.tex􀀂" 0.15900719965509053 "main.js" 0.2571648198751156 "wg0" 2.9112403705085454 "package-lock.json" 0.9332298921513504 "    width: 1200px;􄓇" 0.5549463880672914 "BUI | Transcript John Jones                                                                                                                                                                                     " 0.06340964621351357 ".main-container{􂲚" 0.6220639206484622 ".pagination-number{􄲦" 0.4732541375663234 "Start simple when starting a Zettelkasten                                                                                                                                                             #refine   #refine" 0.8006481694852418 "Yeah, yeah.

It's a, you do it on purpose, but usually it's not on purpose. So I think it's not sustainable, because you don't really like you're doing it for something else. And eventually, it becomes an ordeal. And you're, you are just expressing yourself, for no good reason, you are pursuing some policy objective, which is growth or popularity or whatever, when what you are really trying to do is to broaden your mind or to satisfy this innate sense of curiosity that you have this inquisitive or duplicative mindset that you have. So yeah, it's so you have to put yourself first and then the audience will follow on different even if there is no audience, no problem I would say, no problem, no stress, what matters is whether you can be yourself and what you are doing them to get the most out of that, which is an intellectual activity that satisfies your mind, at the end of the day.􌤋" 0.31356754679843424 "So that was the very first motivation that I had to produce videos." 0.3061204723566016 "    border-radius: 10px;􂴈" 0.6276962561022668 "why_amazing_marvin_is_one_of_a_kind-Jun172021-201735.org􀀁" 0.16239429888142237 "enbl" 0.07825178414761388 "implement" 0.16045431906155455 "similar" 0.20589854228901325 "synthetic" 0.8553586117313603 ".article-container{􂳞" 0.623935727831958 "philosophical" 0.23289050421940272 "    * Similarly, he cites the continual disagreement and multitude of stances between Confucianism, Mohism, etc. as proof􀦖" 0.22464340895049556 "outline-minor-mode" 2.2552301934826797 "RELS0120                                                                                                                                                                                                        " 4.4276941660538744 "claims" 0.21409977647399026 "Daoism believes language induces self-confinement                                                                                                                                                     #refine   #refine" 1.444592105070847 "elisp/faces-rcp.el:30:(defun kb/default-fonts-setup ()" 0.09951340427200858 "experiment" 0.3183136897281373 "How" 0.3732604078125921 "library/useful-emacs-resources.org:39: - [[https://github.com/nobiot/Zero-to-Emacs-and-Org-roam][GitHub - nobiot/Zero-to-Emacs-and-Org-roam: Step by step guide from zero to i...]]" 0.10430757136162225 "    box-shadow: 0 0 41px 0 rgba(200,195,183,0.15);􂴡" 0.5667413768272211 "casper/" 0.38696352137253615 "locales/en.json" 0.5516217042563801 "~Niko Milo                                                                                                                                                                                                      " 0.12110833327107948 "personal.css􀀁" 0.4350697140184186 "handlebars" 0.43376450487636337 "Courses                                                                                                                                                                                                         " 0.3055317713846439 "POBS0930                                                                                                                                                                                                        " 0.09411814038740425 "Friction is resistance to habit and the enemy of change                                                                                                                                               #refine   #refine" 0.16522384966558168 "elisp/early-packages-rcp.el:82:(use-package outshine" 1.985936990741694 "The Zettelkasten index demands the contextualization of knowledge                                                                                                                                     #refine   #refine" 0.9051990764798516 "~Me                                                                                                                                                                                                             " 4.346798354332924 "EAST0650" 0.08112455892361253 "~/main-emacs/elisp/faces-rcp.el􀀂" 0.2380872931970617 "~/Documents/Universe/.obsidian/snippets/personal.css􀀂" 1.302653484208983 "orb-insert-link" 0.06662424730885523 "JRE MMA Show #11 with John Danaher                                                                                                                                                                    #podcast  #podcast" 0.7036124613896758 "*helpful function: ace-link--org-collect*􀀁" 0.1389229109546823 "Questions" 0.7722956964947572 "proselint" 0.33476876564967323 "bibtex-completion-cite-commands" 0.9001824484431542 "Daoism believes language induces self-confinement                                                                                                                                                               " 0.42627458185770356 "bibtex-completion-insert-citation" 0.9110661429076764 "concen" 0.33802759110996905 "How d I decide to make a new Zettel?" 0.7494371162085136 "Surveillance" 0.08039662606602786 "a non-urban area" 0.31735874865895286 "straight-normalize-package" 0.1221174258912901 "something" 0.32703850734566314 "partials/theme_footer.hbs:30:          {{!

So I studied European politics, law and economics. So it was an interdisciplinary study. My focus was of course, on the European integration process from the former way of saying how the EU has gone from a small coalition of states center, sorry a centered aligned a specific sense of interest into what is today federal system of sorts, it wasn't always that way. It wasn't always, we the people of Europe have a federation. That wasn't always but it was something very specific, something like trading power at first, and then it became a single market and then gradually develop substantive law. So like fundamental rights of nature and institutions of the democratic sorts and evolving as a fully-fledged polity. So this is the European integration in a nutshell.

And by reading the whole book, not because it will make any difference to learn midterms itself, but because I want them to actually learn the thing.

But at some point, you have to stand up and say look, you also have to pay me on my own subjectivity, my own personality on my own specific way of conducting myself my own way of operating and they think that this is especially true for people who, like me are actually quiet. And I don't really speak very much, I know this may sound kind of weird. But actually, I'm not really I'm kind of assignment time, and then kind of information to the entire, so I think for the type of the person like me is even more difficult to stand up and say, Hey, you need to think about me as well.
