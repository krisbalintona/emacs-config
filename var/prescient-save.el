The professor gave us homework for the midterm exams and it was be like you have to read chapter one, three and five, something like that. And by reading the whole book, not because it will make any difference to learn midterms itself, but because I want them to actually learn the thing.

But at some point, you have to stand up and say look, you also have to pay me on my own subjectivity, my own personality on my own specific way of conducting myself my own way of operating and they think that this is especially true for people who, like me are actually quiet. And I don't really speak very much, I know this may sound kind of weird. But actually, I'm not really I'm kind of assignment time, and then kind of information to the entire, so I think for the type of the person like me is even more difficult to stand up and say, Hey, you need to think about me as well. So that's what I would say is that stand up and tell people that you exist as well and you have a personality, and you cannot just be the red carpet on which the other will find ways to the others.􀀂􎳋" 0.7015016240055068 "disable-mouse-mode" 1.3191977802753196 "This next question is, you might have a similar answer.
