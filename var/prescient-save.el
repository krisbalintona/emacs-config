So I studied European politics, law and economics. So it was an interdisciplinary study. My focus was of course, on the European integration process from the former way of saying how the EU has gone from a small coalition of states center, sorry a centered aligned a specific sense of interest into what is today federal system of sorts, it wasn't always that way. It wasn't always, we the people of Europe have a federation. That wasn't always but it was something very specific, something like trading power at first, and then it became a single market and then gradually develop substantive law. So like fundamental rights of nature and institutions of the democratic sorts and evolving as a fully-fledged polity. So this is the European integration in a nutshell. So this was my area of expertise and more specifically, it is about a subset of the European Union which is the so called Economic and Monetary Union, part of which is the euro area as a result. Which is the member states of the European Union, and the single currency which is the Euro, not all member states of the European Union have the euro. But anyway, those are technically whose about, the ideas is, that was my area of expertise and that's where I started and that is my area of expertise in terms of [inaudible at 19:31] because I always was an inquisitive mind, I always wanted to read more. I remember we had a class once and I think it was an economics but I‚Äôm not sure about that. The professor gave us homework for the midterm exams and it was be like you have to read chapter one, three and five, something like that. And by reading the whole book, not because it will make any difference to learn midterms itself, but because I want them to actually learn the thing.

Its principles apply to governance which leaves behind no instruction for how individuals should behave, barring the edicts of law. In combination with the fact that a Legalist government does not treat human beings as things that should be supported but, rather, weakened (198), the individual is left to suffer and have no imperative or grounding aside from the one of the state.ÙãÉá" 0.10193429342022124 "happened" 0.6314794494841262 "customize" 0.06627374024873206 "org-roam-teardown" 0.1419390802975573 "org-roam-version" 0.3523586710786706 "org-roam-db-sync" 0.11233991798382269 "This is a headline and should be a node?                                                                                                                                                              #tag #firs#tag #first #person" 0.0763253915014565 "elisp/completion-company-rcp.el" 0.798246224976786 "                     (print (buffer-substring-no-propertiesÙÄ¢ü" 0.2065180965787495 "utilize" 0.08260025701915967 "ENGL0930                                                                                                                                                                                                        " 2.6219702317792013 "conceptualizations" 0.3116889636255648 "Monetize yourself" 0.06190369841852107 "Daoists" 0.4380686116184524 "worthwhile" 0.0630297590230484 "Contently" 0.0653437037315437 "Be your genuine self                                                                                                                                                                                  #refine   #refine" 0.06417630325807702 "* Being a better personÙÄéß" 0.06456310079493952 "aspects" 0.06514767262034907 "access" 0.06495222960248802 "refine" 4.967855064736084 "supported" 0.0763933429036031 "memory" 0.07086543748501699 "** Studying and learningÙÄô™" 0.07150707237613906 "Spaced repetition                                                                                                                                                                                     #refine   #refine" 0.07193805325317884 "information" 0.07215451680358961 "qualities" 0.07324664401276677 "org-roam-mode" 0.08721763123727028 "      (print buffer)ÙÄñô" 0.2028285395142165 "Evergreen notes' titles should function as handles for their content                                                                                                                                  #refine   #refine" 0.7364692829237416 "*helpful command: org-roam-doctor*ÙÄÄÅ" 0.17349113797837945 "org-roam-doctor--check" 0.3506538791643774 "Prepare for when your plan fails                                                                                                                                                                      #refine   #refine" 0.7630697687590515 "Mar232021-152749.org" 0.08745273390946595 "Nov302020-223130.org" 0.09148418344584364 "Nov302020-230421.org" 0.09314832852194613 "Your actions will perfectly reflect your thoughts                                                                                                                                                     #refine   #refine" 1.0490900710002964 "+ [[roam:debarySourcesChineseTradition1999 Sources of Chinese tradition]] Chapter ÙÖé∫" 0.19682517516054926 "disagreement" 0.09891721946701497 " did not have this unconditional faith and sought Legalist views as being better methods for ruling" 0.09921486405919255 "hampering" 0.0998128428004098 "system" 0.10011318234745216 "Legalist thinkers reasoned that ruling by demonstrating virtuosity is inefficient or an unattainable ideal or, at the very least, is not realistic in many circumstances.

But at some point, you have to stand up and say look, you also have to pay me on my own subjectivity, my own personality on my own specific way of conducting myself my own way of operating and they think that this is especially true for people who, like me are actually quiet. And I don't really speak very much, I know this may sound kind of weird. But actually, I'm not really I'm kind of assignment time, and then kind of information to the entire, so I think for the type of the person like me is even more difficult to stand up and say, Hey, you need to think about me as well.
