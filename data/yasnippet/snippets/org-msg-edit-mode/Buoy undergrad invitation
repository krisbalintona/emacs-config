Dear $1,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you on behalf of [[https://www.buoynews.com/][Buoy]], a small publication here at Brown. Our purpose is to inspire and uplift our readers by sharing the stories, experiences, and lessons of students and recent alumni. To date, we've featured over 100 students [[https://www.instagram.com/buoynews/][across Brown]] and [[https://www.instagram.com/buoyumsd/][the University of Michigan School of Dentistry]].

This may feel sudden, but I wanted to personally invite you to be a featured individual in our publication! You were recently nominated as someone who deserves the spotlight, and we believe your story would be a fantastic addition to our publication.

All we ask is for you to answer a few questions that we will send via email and provide a headshot for the thumbnail of your feature — that's it. All you need to do is write a bit about yourself. You can get a sense of what the final product will look like by checking out a few of the features we've published in the past (linked above).

We value the opportunity to share your story and would greatly appreciate your participation. If you are interested, let us know what you think. We'd be glad to hear back from you.
