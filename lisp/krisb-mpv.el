Behaves specially in Dired buffers.  In those cases case, marked files
will be played as a playlist as chronologically displayed in the Dired
buffer.  If no files are marked, just the file at point is played.  (It
is useful to `dired-sort-toggle-or-edit' to control the ordering of
files.  To reverse the order, pass the \"-r\" flag to the listing
switches, done by calling `dired-sort-toggle-or-edit' with `C-u'.)"
